    "content": "Ensuring customer satisfaction through continuous and early delivery of impactful software is the highest priority. Customers will typically have an idea of how they want their software product to function and/or look but never all of the details. Giving the customer functional software in segments throughout the development process allows them to give feedback and change requirements if the project is not going in a direction they like. Although it may seem like a bad thing, this allows the team to make changes on portions of software rather than the entire finished result of the project. This also allows the customer to see progress, which is vitally important to keeping them happy. Accept and welcome changes in requirements at any stage of development, even the later stages. Agile processes improve the customer’s competitive advantage by using change. Changes in requirements can occur for a variety of reasons. The customer could have a change in specific needs the software product will fulfill. The users may need more functionality or a simpler design. The current requirements may not be possible to deliver on considering the time and cost constraints. As an agile team leader, you must be able to adapt to changing requirements as they can come at any time in the development process. You must also be able to quickly relay changes in requirements to your team and redesign the project. Deliver software that is functional quickly and often. Time frames vary from a couple of weeks to several months. Shorter time frames are typically preferred over longer ones. Software deliverables must be able to function on their own within their given timeframe. This allows for feedback from sponsors, as mentioned earlier. Continuous deployment also allows for feedback from users. Business professionals as well as developers must work together on a daily basis over the course of the project’s development. As an agile team leader, it is your job to be the bridge between the business and technical personnel involved in the project. This means being able to understand and sometimes assist with development. You must also be able to communicate technical information such as issues, progress, etc with business professionals. You must also be able to communicate business needs and causes for changes in requirements to your team. Being able to bridge the gap in technical vs. business knowledge is your most vital task. Projects must be built around motivated people. Agile team leads should provide the environment and support necessary to accomplish their tasks. Leads must also trust their team members to execute quality work. Your team members are the lifeblood of your project. Without an environment that motivates them and gives them space to get work done, how can you expect them to remain effective? This is where your previously mentioned communication skills come in. You have the power to tell business professionals what is necessary to build an environment that allows your team to execute the project. You can also manage burnout as this leads to a lack of motivation and therefore a harder time getting work done. Face to face conversation is consistently the best way to convey information and communicate within a development team. Although we live in the 21st century with phones and video calling technology, face to face is hands down the most effective communication method between agile teams. You are more effectively able to solve problems because of the ability to collaborate on a white board or using one person’s computer to debug. Additionally, many things that make face to face communication so effective, like body language, are lost even over video meetings. Face to face is the best way to make sure everyone is on the same page and resolve disagreements when they arise. Software that is functional is the main measure of progress. Agile methodology focuses on delivering working chunks of software. While you can use other metrics to measure progress, functional software will show you, your team, and the customer how much has been completed and how much work is left to be done. Developed and tested software must be delivered in order to get customer and user feedback which is why there is such an emphasis on delivering functional software. Users cannot provide valuable feedback on something that does not work. Agile makes the development process sustainable.  The sponsors, developers, and users should theoretically be able to maintain their pace indefinitely. If you find yourself or your team members burning out or pleading for the relief of being finished with the project, you are not executing agile effectively. You must spread the workload out in a way that is reasonable for your team, the sponsors, and yourself. While there is an expected delivery date for the final product, changes can occur at any time that can push that date further into the future. The environment and workload for agile must be set up in a way that is manageable for everyone involved. Agility is enhanced by repeated attention to technical excellence and good design. You will save a lot of time if you focus a lot of attention on good design. Additionally, your project should be designed in a way that allows for changes in requirements in the future. Technical excellence will help cut down on errors in the future which will also save time for both you and your team. Simplicity – doing as little work as possible to accomplish a task effectively – is a must in agile development environments. Teams that self-organize often create the best architectures, designs, and requirements. Self-organized teams are able to create the best architectures, designs, and requirements because they are intimately familiar with the technical and non-technical details of the project. Good architecture stems from good requirements. Good requirements originate from people with a deep understanding of the problem they are attempting to solve while also understanding the current capabilities of technology. Good designs come from people who are passionate about what they are working on and having the freedom to execute however they want. The team regularly reflects on their current effectiveness and how to improve in the future. The team then adjusts its practices according to the results of reflection. When you reflect on the prior sprint with your team, you should discuss any challenges in communication, workload, and the environment that may be preventing your team from reaching its full potential on the project. You should also elaborate on what things your team is doing well to execute effectively. These reflections are also a chance to congratulate your team members and truly make them feel appreciated. However, simply reflecting is not enough to remain effective. The team must be willing to implement changes found throughout the reflection process. Being adaptable to change is what makes agile teams thrive.",

    "title": "Benefits of Agile Methodology",
    "img": "benefits-agile.png",
    "content": "What is Agile? Agile is a methodology that is used in project management and software development. This methodology is an approach that can help teams take many iterative and incremental steps that can help create a project. These iterative and incremental steps are all short-term and produce a prototype after each cycle. During each cycle, there also will be more innovations for the project that makes each feature more efficient. There are many benefits to using the Agile methodology in a team setting.  How does Agile reduce risks? The first benefit is that it reduces a lot of risks. When a team is applying the Agile method, the theory is that it will never fail. When a project team is using Agile, they will be taking many small cycles called sprints where at the end of each sprint they deliver an unfinished product. With this in mind, the project will never fail and there are fewer risks taken because when you finish one sprint, you do a retrospective of what went well and what went wrong, with that information you can work more efficiently on the next sprint and reduce the number of risks and the chance for failure.  How does Agile increase customer satisfaction? The second benefit is that there will be an increase in customer satisfaction. When creating a product one of the most if not the most important thing is for the product to satisfy the customer. This is why Agile methodology includes customers in their decision-making process. By including customers in their decision-making process, they are able to understand what the product lacks and where they need to improve. Another way the customers are involved is when the company creates prototypes or demos for the customer to try and give feedback, with this feedback the product only becomes more efficient.  How does Agile increase adaptability? The third benefit of using Agile is increased adaptability. This means that when a company uses a methodology like a waterfall, they start with the planning and stick with that planning for the rest of the project. This hinders the project because if there were new innovations that come out, then the waterfall method would not be able to adapt those new innovations since in the planning phase those innovations were not involved. When it comes to Agile since there’s a cycle, once a sprint is done, in the next sprint you can incorporate those new innovations into that sprint which can not only save a lot of time and resources but also make the project more up to date if there are any needs to update in the future.  How does Agile increase team morale? The fourth benefit of using Agile is that it improves team morale. In Agile you are required to do sprint meetings with your project team, there are daily sprint meetings that happen at the start of the day to discuss what is done and what has to be done. During these meetings, the team members get to interact with each other and they learn and grow together due to these interactions. The team is much closer to each other and they are able to discuss any problem they have with their work and have a strong understanding that if they need help they have people that can help them. With this in mind, the team morale is always strong and the productivity of the team is very efficient.  How does Agile increase the quality of the product? The fifth benefit is that there is an increase in product quality when using Agile methodology. This goes back to how adaptable the Agile method is, when you keep doing this iterative process, the team together grows and learns more skills that will help with the project, and because it is an iterative process you can include those new skills to make the project work more efficiently. With each sprint, the team produces a kind of prototype that will have a lot of functionality that the final product will. Over many sprints, the quality of the product will only increase because there will be many additional innovations that will be talked about in the retrospective of each sprint. Other team members can also pitch in and share their thoughts and ideas to better the product in the next sprint. With this in mind, the product will only progress forwards rather than having many setbacks. The Agile method is made so that those setbacks that the team members can experience during the sprints will be brought up at the end of the sprint and can be discussed to fix the upcoming sprint by the other team members.  How does Agile increase visibility between the CEO and their teams? The sixth benefit of the Agile methodology is increased visibility. All increased visibility means that in a company/organization, the leaders of the company are able to see and know what is going on for each project management group and see if they have any feedback or inputs to give. In many organizations/companies, visibility is very important because the CEO or the leaders of the company are the ones making the decisions, and then the teams working for that company follow. When the leaders know what is going on, what is being worked on, and what will be worked on, the company's leadership will increase and the organization as a whole will be more strategic and coordinated. Everyone in the company will be able to benefit from this attribute since the leader will be able to make decisions that not only benefit the company but each and every individual that works for the company to make their upcoming projects successful. What are the main concepts of Agile?  All of the benefits listed will serve helpful to any company that adopts the Agile and methodology. When Agile is put into practice, the company as a whole will be able to benefit from its concepts. These concepts in Agile are mainly based on things like bettering quality, constantly improving the project in every iteration, and being flexible to the changes that happen within and outside of the company, in terms of technological improvements and the transparency where people from the CEO of the company to the customers of the product all know what is going on during these projects. The Agile methodology makes it so that the customers can test out the product and give feedback, all while involving the CEO so they can make smarter decisions that will only benefit the company as a whole.
