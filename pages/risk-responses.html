    <p>After your organization identifies risks for your project, you must create responses that are appropriate for each one. The development of responses is the practice of reducing risks that are negative while enhancing the more positive risks.</p>
    <p>There are five primary strategies for responding to negative risks: Risk avoidance, risk acceptance, risk transference, risk mitigation, and risk escalation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Risk avoidance is the elimination of specific threats. You can typically eliminate a threat by identifying and eliminating the causes of said threat. You may not be able to eliminate every risk you come across, but you may be able to eliminate specific risk events. For example, your team may want to use a specific technology because that is the technology with which they are familiar. While there may be other technologies available that fit the needs of your team, the unfamiliarity poses a high risk to your team and the project’s success. Simply allowing the team to use the software with which they are familiar completely eliminates this risk.</li>
      <li>Risk acceptance is accepting the consequences if a risk occurs. For example, your team can try to reduce the risk of not knowing the meeting location with your stakeholders by deciding a location and having a backup location as a contingency. Your team can alternatively accept the risk by allowing the stakeholder to choose the meeting location.</li>
      <li>Risk transference is the decision to shift the effects of the risk and its responsibility onto a separate third party.  Risk transference is often used with the exposure to financial risk. Your team can purchase insurance for certain necessary hardware. This makes the insurance company financially responsible for replacing the hardware in a short amount of time if anything goes wrong.</li>
      <li>Risk mitigation is a way to reduce the impact of a risk by decreasing the chances of it happening. You can mitigate risk by using technology that has already worked in the past, ensuring that the people involved in the project are well trained, and buying service or maintenance agreements from subcontractors.</li>
      <li>Risk escalation is notifying someone with a higher level of authority about the identified risk. If a risk is outside of the bounds of your project’s scope or the correct response to the risk is outside of your capabilities as a project manager, you should escalate the risk to a manager with more authority in your organization.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Similar to dealing with negative risks, there are five ways you and your team can deal with positive risks: Risk exploitation, risk sharing, risk enhancement, risk acceptance, and risk escalation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Risk exploitation is doing everything in your power to ensure the manifestation of a positive risk. In other words, your actions will increase the chances of the positive risk’s occurrence.  Suppose your company was funding an operation to help feed children in need. Your company would select the best managers to get news coverage, write an article, or set up press conferences to ensure that the operation makes the company look as good as possible. This would lead to more sales for your company in the future.</li>
      <li>Risk sharing can apply to positive risk as well as negative risk. In the case of the company and their fundraiser, the company can share risk with the school’s principal by asking for support from teachers and parents. This helps share the responsibility of the operation’s success between multiple parties and not just the company.</li>
      <li>Risk enhancement is a way of changing the size of the opportunity through the identification of important factors. The parents, teachers, and schools involved in the program would likely stir up more press coverage for the company. This increases the likelihood of the operation increasing the company’s profit margin.</li>
      <li>Risk acceptance in relation to positive is when the organization does not take any action to modify the opportunity. If the company assumes the fundraiser will boost public relations, they may not schedule a press conference or any extra work for news coverage.</li>
      <li>Risk escalation is the same with positive risks as negative risks. As a manager, you may escalate a risk to a higher level manager who has more influence with the organization your team will work with to get a better outcome.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your team’s risk response planning will output changes to the project management plan, other project documents, as well as change requests.</p>
    <p>Risk response strategies will require your team to identify residual and secondary risks. Residual risks are the remaining risks involved in the project after the application of your team’s response strategies. In an Agile environment, there will likely be residual risks regardless of how many contingencies you plan because of the nature of changing requirements and scope constraints.  Secondary risks are the result of applying a risk response. For example, if you decide to switch languages to ensure future compatibility, some modules of your project not functioning as intended would be a secondary risk.</p>
    <p>The main chunk of your work in project risk management is going to be the implementation of responses to risk that have been determined by your team. The primary outputs of this function of your role include issue logs, lessons-learned documents, project team assignments, a risk report, and a risk register. For example, your team may identify a risk in bringing on a new client for a project. Your team may identify several actions you can take to minimize this risk such as taking time to fully understand the new client, planning and attending a meeting with the client to ensure they are on the same page as the rest of the team, and ensuring your attendance of this meeting. These risk responses are proactive for reducing the risk of bringing on the new client. When you implement these responses, you will actively help eliminate the potential negative effects of the new client and project.</p>
    <p>You will also need to monitor risks by ensuring that the predetermined risk responses are performed. You will also track the effectiveness of these risk responses by taking note of their effects on the outcome of the risk.</p>
