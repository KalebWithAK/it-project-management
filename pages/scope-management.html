        <h3>What is project scope management?</h3>
        <p>Simply put, project scope management is a way of creating outlines that will help create the project's final
            product. These outlines will make sure to keep the project within the limits that project managers set.
            Project managers are the ones that are responsible for guiding their teams through each project cycle and in
            Agile methodology, there are bound to be many life cycles for a singular project. These limitations that are
            set will help the project achieve its goals, deadlines, and deliverables that were requested. When you
            create this project scope while thinking about the Agile methodology, you have to be in strong communication
            with the stakeholders and the customers, and the rest of the project management team. When forming this
            strong relationship with multiple groups, you will need to structure that project around what the team is
            going to and not going to do and give them precise objectives to work on. Scope management has six
            processes, planning scope management, collecting requirements, defining scope, creating the Work Breakdown
            Structure, validating scope, and finally controlling scope.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Step 1: Creating the scope management plan</h3>
        <p>The first step in creating a scope management plan is to create a scope plan document. The scope plan
            document has three main components. The first component is the scope statement, which is used to specify the
            expected final results and products of the project. The second and third components of the scope plan
            document are the breakdown of project requirements and any other deliverables that were planned. When
            creating the scope plan document, you can also include a change control process. The change control process
            is something that is used to change requests so that you can avoid future scope creeps. Scope creeps are
            when the asks from stakeholders or customers to CEOs start to outweigh the scope of the project which in
            return would increase the chances of the project failing.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Step 2: Collect the project requirements</h3>
        <p>When using agile methodology, involving all the stakeholders as well as customers and other team members is
            very important. In this step, you collect all the project requirements and make sure you know everything
            that the stakeholders need and want so that the project can meet its requirements. The goal of this step is
            to just gather as much information and requirements as possible from the stakeholders that are a part of the
            project scope.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Step 3: Defining the scope</h3>
        <p>When using agile methodology, after involving all the stakeholders which are very important, refining that
            information and requirements and sharing it with the rest of the team is the next important step. When
            refining these requirements, you can take that information and create a strong and effective scope and
            product description, for the team members to follow.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4: Creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</h3>
        <p>When using agile methodology, the Work Breakdown Structure helps divide the project into different levels of
            tasks to make sure the objective gets done and all of the team members are able to complete what they’re
            needed to do. There are usually three levels/components for a Work Breakdown Structure. Level 1 would be the
            basic project objectives and levels 2 and 3 are all dependencies or sub-dependencies of the level above them
            with level 1 being the highest level. This is a hierarchical structure of tasks that helps you to monitor
            and control where your project is going all at the same time as keeping all the team members involved.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Step 5: Validating the scope</h3>
        <p>In agile methodology, this is a very important step when it comes to creating a project scope management
            plan. In agile you are encouraged to keep the stakeholders in the loop of the project and this step does
            exactly that. Validating the scope makes it so that you can show the stakeholders what the objectives and
            other deliverables are for the project and have them basically sign off on it. This way the stakeholders
            will be able to look at the plan and see if what they are expecting is the plan to be finished by the
            deadline they are expecting. The stakeholders will understand the project better and this will also majorly
            decrease future scope creep. Since the stakeholders are the main ones that are asking for things to be added
            to the project, with this agile approach you can make sure that those asks don’t happen later in the future
            when it starts to affect the scope of the project but rather those asks being a part of the project from the
            planning phase. Another important thing that comes along with validating the scope would be that the project
            team can get good feedback from the stakeholders, they can show and point out things that need improvement
            or need to be added to make the project more effective.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Step 6: Controlling the scope</h3>
        <p>In agile methodology, it is very effective to make sure you can change and adapt to different situations that
            come up. In the last step of creating a project scope management plan, you are to monitor the status of the
            project and see if there are any changes that need to be made or are going to be made because of the status
            of the project. There are many ways to go about this, you can use project management software and with that,
            you will be given many tools that can help you share the project with stakeholders and other customers to
            try to get back feedback. You can also use these tools to make sure that you can see all the changes in
            real-time where you will be given status updates on what changes and what gets improved.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, planning scope management is very important to any project manager. An example that comes to
            mind is if you wanted to go out and get some new house appliances, and you go and get those items and come
            back home just to realize that you forgot to buy some of the appliances that you really needed but instead
            but ones that you already had. This happened because of poor planning and you have now just spent
            unnecessary money on things that you didn’t even mean to. This same analogy applies to scope management when
            it comes to project managers. A good and precise project scope can help project managers not have to deal
            with problems like requirements being constantly changing, wasting time on unnecessary features in the
            project and not being able to meet the deadlines because of it, and wasting money on things that you didn’t
            expect to in the first place.
