        <h2>Controlling Communication</h2>

        <p><strong>Communication in a project management team</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Communication between members of a project management team can be very challenging but also bring
            about the best in everyone, which will provide the best product for whichever project the team is working
            towards. There are many things to keep in mind when it comes to communication, you always need to make sure
            that the team is in constant communication with not only each other but also the stakeholders, customers,
            the higher management to make sure that they are creating a deliverable that is not only efficient but also
            desired by the customers and stakeholders. Team members have to be effective and can also only be effective
            if the team makes sure that they are not taking time away from their tasks, which is the main goal of
            communication within a project team.

        <p><strong>Poor communication within the team can cause project failure</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Some of the things that will get affected when a team has poor communication are that there would be a
            lot of misunderstandings about the goals and objectives of the project. The team will also be prone to
            missing a lot of deadlines because those dates were possibly never communicated with the team. With the lack
            of communication, there can also be conflicts between team members, certain members in the team heading in
            different directions of the project, decreasing the productivity of each team member which in return will
            mean that the project budget might have to be raised, and finally, there will be a lack of commitment to the
            project which will certainly decrease the productivity and may even cause project failure.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Poor communication with stakeholders can cause project failure</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Some of the things that will get affected when a team has poor communication with their stakeholders
            are that there is a lack of or there is limited buy-in for the project, this would mean that there might be
            a chance that the project will not have enough funding or resources. One of the main things that lead to the
            success of a project is you can meet the expectations of the stakeholders, not being able to communicate
            with them would surely lead to failure. Another major thing is that without communication with the
            stakeholders, they will not be involved with the project which will mean that you have less help with it
            comes to getting the project accomplished and that will eventually lead to the failure of the project.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Communication planning</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Some things that can help with communication planning between the project team, stakeholders, and
            other involved parties are very simple. The first question that you should ask your team is who will you be
            communicating with throughout the project, this can be done by making a list of all the people that are
            involved in the project and all the people that the team needs to be in constant communication with. The
            second thing that the team should understand is the information that will be communicated, this can also be
            written down and when you do get to the meeting, you can communicate with the parties accordingly. The third
            thing that you will need to think about is when and how you will communicate. During this time, there are
            times when certain members or parties are not able to make it to meetings, if it is possible the team can
            make the meeting online and at a time that is suitable for everyone. Simply being able to communicate with
            each other will help you understand and get down most of these steps down, if you meet with the members of
            the team make sure to talk about the next time the whole team, stakeholders, and other parties are meeting
            and where they are all meeting, this will make the planning process much easier.

        <p><strong>Ways of communicating with multiple parties</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;In the day and age that we live in, there are many ways to communicate between many different parties.
            The first way of communication can just be a one-on-one meeting where a project manager can meet with a
            stakeholder to discuss the future direction of the project or if certain things need to be changed or
            updated in the project so far. Another way of communicating would be to meet in small groups to discuss the
            project. These meetings are very important but they are also a very formal kind of meeting, the reason for
            these meetings is to communicate information about the project, so it does not matter how these parties
            meet. For example, team members and other stakeholders can even meet during lunch times to discuss the
            project. If the reason for the meeting is meant to be short or if there is just some sort of a question
            between team members or certain stakeholders, the best case of communication would be things like email, or
            virtual meetings that are planned beforehand.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Challenges that come with long-distance members</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Some of the challenges that come with having stakeholders or team members abroad would just be able to
            find the time to communicate because of the time difference or being able to meet because of the distance.
            This can be easily solved with software like Zoom, Skype, and Webex that help make these kinds of meetings
            possible. The team members and stakeholders can talk about a time when they are all free regarding the time
            difference and once they find the time when they are all able to meet, they can all create a virtual meeting
            that will help them communicate face-to-face about all the discussion topics to ensure the success of the
            project.

        </p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;In conclusion, making sure that you are able to communicate with all the members that are involved in
            the project is very important. With a lack of communication, the members of the project can head off track
            which will then eventually lead to each member heading in a different direction for the project and the
            stakeholders also not being able to get what they want. With communication, whether it is virtual or
            in-person, communicating between the members and stakeholders will establish a ground where everyone
            involved in the project will know where the project is heading and they will also know where they are
            supposed to head towards. Communication will help each member finish their part of the project and in
            return, it will ensure the projectâ€™s success.
