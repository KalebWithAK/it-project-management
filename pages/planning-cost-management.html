        <p class="text-title"><strong>Planning Cost Management</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;There are four main steps in Project Cost Management. Before we get into the steps for planning cost
            management, let's talk about how important project cost management is. Think about planning cost management
            in real-life terms, if you were to invest or buy a car or a house, the first thing you would think about is
            how much money you have and how much money can you put forth to get this car and household. To do this, you
            need to set a budget, this budget will include everything that you are planning to spend on this car or
            house. The budget will consist of things like what kind of car you would like, what kind of house and
            furniture you would like to put inside, what size lot you would like, do you want to add extra features that
            come with the houses like reflective windows, refrigerator, microwaves, etc. There are a lot of things that
            come with “just buying a house” and planning cost management makes it so that you can make sure that you are
            taking the right steps when it comes to cost efficiency. Many good things can come out of planning cost
            management as a project manager. Here are some, when planning cost management you can make sure to set clear
            expectations with the stakeholders so that they don’t request anything outside of your budget. Another is
            when planning cost management, you can keep track of the scope creep by keeping a steady budget with the
            involved customers and also making sure that they don’t go over the budget. With planning cost management,
            you can also keep track of the progress you are making and make sure that you are spending your resources on
            the necessary things. With planning cost management, you will also make sure that you do not lose money in
            the project, make sure that you can increase your ROI, as well as maintain the wanted margin. Lastly, with
            planning cost management, you will be able to create a benchmark for future projects so that you can maybe
            use this kind of budget for the next project or maybe even create a better one.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 1: Project resource planning</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The first step in planning cost management is resource planning. This part of the planning is where
            you take a look at all the resources that are required to complete the project. The things that are referred
            to as resources can be things like people, contractors, and employees. The resources are also equipment
            things as infrastructure, vehicles that will be needed, and specialized equipment that can be used during
            the project. Resource planning is something that is done at the start of every project to note down all the
            resources that will be needed to take this project from start to finish.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 2: Cost Estimation</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The second step is cost estimation. This part of the planning is not only just looking at all the
            resources that you will be needing but also looking at how much they are going to cost you. You have to find
            and have resources that cost the good amount that will fit the budget and also still be effective enough to
            take your project from start to finish. Some of the things that will be needed to make this cost estimation
            during this part of the planning process are things like the resource equipment and how much money each of
            them will take, the time it will take for that resource to be used, so like if they are borrowed vehicles
            then the longer the time takes the more money will be expended, a list of assumptions where things might
            take longer or have risks, and the past cost benchmarks is there is any to have a better understanding of
            how much it will cost, and also making sure that your company’s financial health is strong enough to handle
            the cost estimation.

        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 3: Cost budgeting</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The third step is cost budgeting. This part of the planning is often viewed as part of estimation or
            as its process. Cost budgeting is where you take all the information that you have learned from the last two
            steps and put it into separate tasks or modules. For example, if you and your company wanted to start a
            project that would take you around 5 years to complete and your entire budget for that project is around 5
            million dollars, you wouldn’t just have the company spend those 5 million dollars to someone or something.
            Instead, the project manager would have to split that amount of money into quarters of a year so that you
            can allocate chunks of the money for each module or task of a project. This is very helpful because rather
            than just using the money straight from an account with 5 million inside, you would have an account that has
            just enough to make that task or module of the project work and so on till the entire project is completed.
            This makes sure that you don’t spend too much or spend unnecessarily.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 4: Cost Control</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;In this fourth and final step in planning cost management, you will not exactly be doing anything
            extra rather than just making sure that everything is going as the cost management plan. If there are
            unexpected problems that come up and it happens so that you have spent a lot of time and resources on
            something that did not end up working then you will have to raise the budget and make sure that you can
            allocate enough money and resources to fix that problem this time and continue with the project.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Planning cost management is something that is crucial to the start and success of any project. Project
            managers need to make sure that all the resources that will be used from the start to the end of a project
            are recorded and needed. As well as having to make sure that the budget does not have to increase if
            everything goes as planned, but at the same time if there is a need for the budget to be increased, then the
            manager has to act accordingly to make sure that that money is accessible and the problem is noted to make
            sure something like that doesn’t happen again. Planning cost management is very important to the success of
            any project within any organization.
