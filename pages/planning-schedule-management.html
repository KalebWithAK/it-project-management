    <p>
        As an Agile project manager, it is useful to understand what schedule management is and the process of planning the schedule management throughout the project. What is project schedule management and why is it important? Simply put, project schedule management involves the processes needed to complete a project on time. Several issues may come up during a project, such as individual work styles, cultural differences, and personal matters. It is important to keep everyone on track to complete the project in a timely manner. Time will pass no matter what occurs during a project. 
    </p>

    <h3>The Processes of Project Schedule Management</h3>
    <p>
        There are six processes involved with project schedule management that will help project teams and everyone involved to complete the project in a timely manner. The following processes are originally defined from the Information Technology Project Management book by Kathy Schwalbe 9th Edition, pages 243-244:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Planning schedule management - determining policies, documentation, and procedures that would be utilized for planning, executing, and controlling the schedule of the project.
        </li>
        <li>
            Defining activities - identifying activities that project team members and everyone else involved must do to produce the deliverables of the project. Each of these activities will have an expected cost, duration, and resource requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sequencing activities - identifying and documenting the relationships between activities of the project. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Estimating activity - estimating the amount of work periods that are required to finish activities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developing the schedule - analyzing activity sequences, resource requirements, and duration estimates to create the schedule of the project.
        </li>
        <li>
            Controlling the schedule - controlling and overseeing changes to the schedule of the project.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These processes are all highly important, but this blog post will hone in on planning schedule management, which is the first process to consider when dealing with project schedule management. This process is about planning how the schedule will be managed during the life of the project. The schedules of projects are formed from the basic paperwork that start up a project. A schedule plan will be created and it may be broad or detailed depending on the requirements of the project. All schedule plans would include the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Project schedule model development
        </li>
        <li>
            Level of accuracy and units of measure
        </li>
        <li>
            Control thresholds
        </li>
        <li>
            Rules of performance measurement
        </li>
        <li>
            Reporting formats
        </li>
        <li>
            Process descriptions
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project Schedule Model Development</h3>
    <p>
        All schedule plans include some sort of schedule model. A schedule model portrays the overall plan for enacting the activities of a project, which include the durations, dependencies, and any other information needed for planning in regards to resources. Schedule models have multiple uses in project management, but are not limited to the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plan of execution for a project</li>
        <li>Identifying possible risks and issues that may come up during the project</li>
        <li>Talking with stakeholders about the project plan</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide an overview of the activities, durations, and dependencies of the project.</li>
        <li>Project managers may avoid giving their team members too many tasks at the same time, which means that they wonâ€™t burnout and/or risk missing important deadlines.</li>
        <li>Improving communication and accountability among everyone working on the project.</li>
        <li>Project managers will have a detailed schedule for the project, which will aid them in finding potential issues and risks before they come to light.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Level of Accuracy</h3>
    <p>
        Level of accuracy highlights how accurate estimates of the schedule should be and determines how time is measured.  As projects progress, the level of accuracy increases. The idea behind accurate estimates of the project schedule is finding the perfect balance between scope, cost, and time. It is important to maintain a balance between those three items, as it prevents project-cost overruns, the project not being completed in time, and other negative situations that may occur.

    </figure>
    <h3>Control Thresholds</h3>
    <p>
        These thresholds are put in place for monitoring the performance of the schedule. In this case, the thresholds are upper or lower limits that are set based on variances, which are the differences between expected results and actual results. Thresholds can show the maximum stress level which a deliverable may function without reducing its efficiency and quality. An example of a threshold would be +/- 10% in regards to variance of the project. 
    </p>

    <h3>Rules of Performance Measurement</h3>
    <p>
        Performance measurement provides the project manager the insights to ensure that the manager is carrying on with the project within the time and cost thresholds, as well as seeing if the project is executing according to plan. Measuring project performance is also useful for making project managers aware if the project is going over budget or behind schedule, so that corrective actions can take place to keep the project going. Project managers should start with giving credit for the work performed by employee(s), amount of work given to subordinates, and what should be put into the project's budget. 
    </p>

    <h3>Reporting Formats</h3>
    <p>
        Schedule reports that are required for the project will be written in various formats and frequencies depending on the needs of the project. These reports are documents that go into the details of the progress during the project. Project managers use schedule reports to inform stakeholders of the project's progress and monitor the scope, cost, and time of the project. It generally includes the following details:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Work that has been completed</li>
        <li>What will come after the report</li>
        <li>The summary of the schedule and budget of the project</li>
        <li>Action item list</li>
        <li>Problems and risks that came up, and how they are handled</li>
    </ul>

    </figure>
    <h3>Process Descriptions</h3>
    <p>
        The schedule plan will include descriptions on how the rest of the schedule management processes will be executed. 
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Agile project managers should plan how their schedules would be managed throughout the project. Project managers will produce schedule plans, whether broad or specific, that will all include the project schedule model development, level of accuracy and units of measure, control thresholds, rules of performance measurement, reporting formats, and process descriptions. All of these factors will be communicated with stakeholders to keep them informed of the project's progress and to see if there are any issues that came up during the project life. By creating a schedule plan, risks can be managed and the three important factors of project management (scope, cost, and time) can be balanced to ensure project success.
