        As an aspiring or current Agile project manager in the field of information technology, you may have heard of project quality management. What exactly does project quality management entail? Why is it important within the field of project management with Agile methodologies? How does it relate to the IT sector? You have a desire to strengthen your knowledge in Agile project management and to become a better project manager than before. 
    </p>

    <h3>What is Quality?</h3>
    <p>The word “quality” has several definitions, such as the totality of features and characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs (International Organization for Standardization ISO8042:1994) or conformance to requirements and fitness for use. The definitions are broad and open to interpretation, so it is your responsibility as a project manager to understand your customer's definition of quality to be successful in your organization. </p>
    <p>
        In regards to quality, conformance to requirements are the written specifications that products meet. An example of this would be making sure a certain number of servers with specific capabilities are suitable for delivery. Fitness for use is defined as a product that can be used for its intended purpose. An example of fitness for use is if the servers were not delivered with the proper hardware to make them function properly, then they would be deemed not fit for use.

    <p>
        Quality should be on the same level with scope, time, and cost of a project. If stakeholders of the project are not happy with the quality of the project management or the end deliverables from the project, the team developing the project must change their scope, time, and cost accordingly. You, the project manager, should not do the bare minimum and just meet the written expectations of the project. You should have a great relationship with all stakeholders involved in the project and know what they want from it.
    </p>

    <h3>The Purpose of Project Quality Management</h3>
    <p>
        Now that you have an understanding of what quality can be defined as, project quality management serves a purpose to make sure that the project will meet and satisfy the requirements for which it was accepted. An important aspect of project management is to meet or exceed the needs of stakeholders. Project teams and managers should strive to make good relationships with stakeholders and the main customers behind their projects to understand what their definition of quality means. <em>Just remember that the customer has the final say if the quality of the end product is acceptable.</em> 
    </p>

    <h3>The Importance of Quality in Project Quality Management</h3>
    <p>
        One question regarding information technology worth noting after defining quality and project quality management would be how does quality affect the world around us? Businesses and organizations around the world provide their employees with computer access. Many people use the Internet and our daily routines rely on high quality IT products. Computers aid in food production and distribution, performance tracking and global positioning systems in cars, education for students in schools and colleges, many functions for corporations, and entertainment or personal use for the average person. IT systems are even used in navigation systems within aircraft and provide smart capabilities to TVs, fridges, and other household appliances. IT systems are used in first responding areas that may be life or death such as military services, emergency medical services, fire departments, and law enforcement agencies.

    <p>
        The previous paragraph alone should provide enough information on how important it is to meet quality standards in Agile project management. You can prevent extreme cases of identity theft and data breaches by maintaining high quality standards for your products. If you fail to maintain quality standards in your products, then you could potentially cost future customers from ever doing business with your organization. 
    </p>

    <h3>The Processes of Project Quality Management</h3>
    <p>
        There are three main processes in project quality management:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>Planning quality management:</em> This process identifies which requirements and standards in regards to quality are related to the project and how to meet and/or satisfy them. Implementing quality standards into a design of a project is a critical aspect of quality planning. In regards to an IT project, standards of quality may include permitting for system growth, planning for a response time that is reasonable for a system, or making sure that the system outputs accurate and consistent results. The main outputs include plans of quality management, quality metrics, project documents updates, and project management plan updates. In regards to metrics, they are a standard unit of measurement. Examples of such metrics include availability of goods and services, failure rate of products, and ratings of customer satisfaction. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Managing quality:</em> Also known as quality assurance, this process gives evidence that all activities regarding quality being completed are defined. These activities have to follow the organization’s quality regulations. This process is typically performed on the deliverables and management procedures of the project with the use of process checklists or project audits. The main outputs include quality reports, evaluation documents, change requests, project documents updates, and project management plan updates.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Controlling quality:</em> This process monitors specific results of the project to make sure that those results are complete, meet the customer’s standards, and are correct. Pareto charts, quality control charts, and statistical sampling are all tools that are utilized for managing quality in your projects. The main outputs include measurements for quality control, work performance information, change requests, verified deliverables, project documents updates, and project management plan updates.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        As an aspiring or current project manager practicing Agile methodologies, you are now familiar with what project quality management is, why it is important, and how it relates to the sector of information technology. Most, if not all, organizations and businesses around the world rely on IT systems. These IT systems are used professionally or recreationally, but all must meet the high quality standards that consumers demand of them. Your goal should be to satisfy or exceed the needs of the customer and your customer is the one who ultimately decides what the meaning of quality is for your project.
