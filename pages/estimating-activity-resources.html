        <p class="text-title"><strong>What does estimating activity resource mean?</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Estimating activity resources means that it is a process within a project team that will help them
            assess and understand the number of things and materials they need to ensure the project's success. These
            are things and resources that are required in order to make sure that the project can be completed and these
            are tools that are also required. Something that is good with this process is that the project team will be
            able to identify things like the quantity and other features that are needed to finish that particular
            activity in the project. With this, you can also make sure that the project team is able to manage the cost
            and how long the duration of the project will take from start to finish. This process is also something that
            happens during the project lifecycle and it can be performed whenever the project team decides to. There are
            also many steps that are involved when it comes to estimating activity resources, and these steps will be
            explained throughout the blog post.


        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 1: Understanding Resource Availability</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Something that is important when it comes to reviewing resource availability is that you need to make
            sure that the project has all the resources needed to complete the project. It is very important to also
            make sure that the availability of these resources is planned during this process so that they can be used
            during the project.

        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 2: Understanding the Work Breakdown Structure and Activity List</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Another step in this process that is important is to understand the work breakdown structure. The work
            breakdown structure is like a framework that helps the project team understand all the data, products, and
            services that are being provided and with the use of that knowledge create a structure that will help them
            successfully complete their given tasks. The four main elements of a work breakdown structure are scope,
            schedule, deliverables, and cost. These elements help form a strong work breakdown structure which then
            ensures the success of a project. So understanding WBS and the activity list will be evaluated in the
            project and they need to be audited in the estimating activity resources process.


        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 3: Finding resources that are potentially available</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The third step in estimating activity resources is to see a project team and identify what resources
            are potentially available for their team. The resources that are given to the team are not always the best
            and the ones that are potentially available could help the project team succeed or make their product even
            more effective, so identifying these resources are important. These are things that must be recognized
            during this process because there can be times when it could be possible to complete a specific project task
            and these resources would have to be available in order to do that.

        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 4: Understanding the historical data and context of reusing
                resources</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The fourth step in estimating activity resources would be for a project team to understand the
            historical data about the reuse of resources. This means that if there was a project that was done before
            the current project, and both of the projects are somewhat similar, you can take a look at the resources
            that were used in the past project to determine or get a better understanding of the type of or amount of
            resources that you will need to use for the current project.


        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 5: Understanding the policies for resource usage for their
                organization</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;During the estimating activity resources phase, you have to make sure to check the policies that the
            organization has when it comes to how to find and ask for resources, how to assign projects, and how to also
            monitor the project throughout the project lifecycle. These are very important to estimating the activity
            resources process because they can help the project team members use the resources only when they are needed
            and there will be less wasted on wrong things.


        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 6: Understand what resources are actually available and needed by the
                team</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The sixth step for estimating activity resources is to completely understand what resources are needed
            and are readily available to the team. These resources mostly mean the people that are going to be working
            on the project, so understanding the skills of each of these team members is crucial to making sure that the
            project is well and you are able to gather good experts for the project so that the product can be more
            effective and at its best.

        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 7: Decisions to make during estimating activity resources
            </strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The seventh step for estimating activity resources is to make the correct decisions when it comes to
            the process. An example of this is to make sure that if you are doing a specific task in the project and you
            need a specific resource, you need to make sure that you are able to acquire that resource and or lease it
            for the time until the task is done. This step makes sure that a project team is able to utilize its
            resources well.

        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 8: Make sure to break down more complex activities for better
                estimation</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Another important step in the estimating activity resources process is to make sure that you can break
            down the more complex activities and tasks so that your estimation can be more accurate. Even though your
            work breakdown structure is something that will help with that, the more complex activities would still need
            to be broken down during the estimation phase to make sure that if there are problems with the task, the
            breakdown would help recover.

        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 9: Make sure the resource requirements are quantified</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;This process is important because this makes the project team really think about all the resources
            that they need and which ones they will need to make sure the task is successful. Quantifying their
            resources would help the team evaluate which resources they need for each activity.

        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Step 10: Updating documents for the project</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Making sure to update the project archives will not only help keep a track of all the resources that
            were used but also that these projects can help you in future projects if they are similar or even to see if
            they can use past resources.
