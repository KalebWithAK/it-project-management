        <p>One of the most crucial aspects of working in an Agile environment in any project is teamwork. Good teamwork
            and cooperation is imperative in fields such as software development, because most projects in these fields
            tend to be large-scale and complex. Just imagine the number of people working on projects such as
            videogames, search engines, or AI software, these teams may have a strength of over a hundred people with
            millions of dollars in investment. When the stakes are that high, all precautions must be undertaken to
            ensure the project goes smoothly. Therefore, to ensure the success of a project, good teamwork and skills
            and technologies that improve teamwork are essential. </p>
        <p>Some people may be reluctant to work in teams. This may be due to their negative past experiences with poor
            or ineffective teamwork. Nonetheless, at some point they will have to participate in teams, since teamwork
            is so important. To ensure that future team efforts are successful, it is important to understand how to
            guarantee effective teamwork. All team members must have a clear understanding of the project and have clear
            communication between themselves. A team leader should promote this understanding and facilitate good
            communication, so that every team member is familiar with the direction of the project.</p>
        <p>This blog post endeavors to explore some tools, techniques and strategies for project team and resource
            management with the hope that a better understanding of those will result in increased productivity and
            innovation. </p>


        <h3>Choosing A Leader</h3>

        <p>A team leader plays a vital role in the success of a team. This is because they act as a central point for
            communications and task management. Not only do they assign and delegate tasks, but they also provide
            guidance. Since it is such an important role, a leader must be someone who has earned their team’s trust.
            They should also have excellent soft skills and leaderships skills. Sometimes, the leadership role may be
            rotated among team members, in order to ensure each member gets a chance at leadership development. That may
            allow for more collaboration and mutual understanding. A good leader also observes the strengths of their
            team members and utilizes those while understanding their weaknesses and encouraging improvement there. Good
            leaders are essential to the success of projects.</p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>

        <p>Communication is the most important aspect of teamwork if not one of the most important. It is crucial to the
            success of projects because poor communication may lead to lower productivity, higher cost, and projects
            being delivered overdue. Furthermore, communication between technical and non-technical colleagues within
            the project may be strained by the use of jargon. It is important to understand that communication skills
            play just as important a role as technical skills in the success of a project.</p>

        <p>Good communication is promoted by focusing on individual and group needs, using the correct medium for
            communication at the right place and time, and distributing information in an effective and timely manner.
            Adding too many people in a team to try and speed up a task may be counterproductive as more people create
            more communication channels and more chance for miscommunication. Moreover, if an email is sent out when a
            real time meeting was required or a meeting was held for something that could have been an email, it may
            result in loss of time and money. Lastly, information should reach its destination at the right time and
            without being altered, otherwise, this may also cause losses. A lot more can be said about communication,
            because it is essential to the success of any project.</p>

        <h3>Understanding what motivates employees</h3>

        <p>What motivates us to do what we do? Motivational theories attempt to answer this very question. Motivation
            may be divided in two kinds, intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is that which comes from within
            and motivates people for their own enjoyment. Extrinsic motivation comes from external rewards or
            punishments. It's important to understand motivational theory to work effectively with others.</p>

        <h3>Gantt Charts</h3>


        <p>Projects that span a long period of time may utilize Gantt Charts to create a clear and detailed work
            schedule. Often, these charts are used in proposals to demonstrate to stakeholders that the team has a
            well-organized and viable plan for delivering the project. Gantt Charts can also be used in progress reports
            to inform the reader which tasks have been completed, which are in progress, and which are still not done.
        </p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Gantt Charts come in many different forms, and complex and detailed charts can be created using software
            (examples are available on the Wikipedia page for Gantt Charts). For course assignments, it is recommended
            to use a simple table to create Gantt Charts. Figure 1 provides a sample chart that demonstrates the types
            of tasks that could be included in a Research Project Proposal. The sample chart includes generic tasks, but
            ideally, the chart should have more specific information such as the type of existing designs to be
            researched, the specific kind of user experience, and a literature review on what specific topic.</p>


        <h3>Team Charters</h3>

        <p>A team charter is a way for teams to describe and define the different details of a project, such as purpose,
            duration and scope. The idea is to help team members to all be on the same page and concur with each other.
            It helps misunderstandings from arising in the future by defining expectation early on. Its points can be
            negotiated so that everyone agrees on what is being added to the charter. It also lists the tools and
            strategies that will be utilized in the scenario of something going wrong. </p>

        <h3>Training and Team-building Activities</h3>

        <p>To build effective teams, organizations offer in-house training or hire external companies specialized in
            team-building activities. It's crucial to consider individual needs, such as learning styles and physical
            limitations, when selecting team-building options. These activities may be physical or mental. These
            team-building activities aim to help team members to understand each other's differences and work together
            effectively.</p>

        <h3>Resource Mangaement Software</h3>

        <p>Different software is available to help manage project teams and resources. An example is Microsoft Project
            2016.</p>
