    <h2>Procurement Planning</h2>
    <p>By: Kaleb Dean</p>

    <img src="../images/procurement-planning.jpeg">

    <p>As a project manager, each knowledge area you are responsible for will require planning to achieve the success of the project. Procurement planning requires you to consider how procurement processes will be managed. This includes developing the documentation for making procurement decisions from companies outside of your organization as well as acquisitions to project closure. </p>
    <p>Your procurement management plan should include the following key elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Guidelines to determine what situations require what contracts</li>
      <li>Standard procurement templates and documents if you or your organization has developed them</li>
      <li>A set of guidelines for the creation of work breakdown structures, statements of work, and other procurement documents for the contract</li>
      <li>Delegated roles and responsibilities for your team and other teams within the organization, such as the financial or legal departments</li>
      <li>Rules for using estimates that are independent of one another to create a more accurate evaluation of sellers</li>
      <li>Suggestions to deal with multiple providers</li>
      <li>Processes for syncing progress with other areas of the project such as performance reporting and scheduling</li>
      <li>Assumption and limits to be set related to acquisition and purchases</li>
      <li>Timelines of leads for purchases and acquisitions</li>
      <li>Strategies that will reduce the risk of purchase and acquisition, including bonds and insurance contracts</li>
      <li>A set of guidelines for determining pre qualified sellers and a list of preferred sellers that should be common throughout your organization</li>
      <li>Procurement metrics which will assist you in evaluating sellers and managing your variety of contracts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Statement of Work</h3>
    <p>The statement of work (SOW) is essentially the work required for procurement. Your organization may use the term statement of work to describe internal work as well. If you create a statement of work but it only refers to the work required for one contract, it is considered a contract statement of work. A contract statement of work provides scope and describes the work in clear detail in order to allow sellers to determine if they can commit to supplying the required goods and services at the designated time interval. The contract statement of work will also be used by sellers to determine a price for their goods and services. When you develop a contract statement of work, you should be clear, concise, and complete to the best of your ability. Your contract statement of work must describe all the services required and include reporting on performance. Your wording is important when developing a contract statement of work. Switching words like “must” with “may” can create a completely different meaning and is likely to be misinterpreted by sellers. “Must” means that something has to be done; “may” implies that something could be left out. You do not want your requirements to be misconstrued so your word choice must be deliberate. The contract statement of work should use industry terms and refer to industry standards to specify the products and services required.</p>
    <p>Most organizations use templates and samples to aid with the generation of statements of work. If you are procuring hardware, you should specify the manufacturer and model number of the hardware involved, the former hardware and new ones, and the quantity of the hardware involved. The contract statement of work should also declare the location where the work will be performed, the expected timeframe for performance, specific deliverables and their deadlines, standards that are applicable, acceptance criteria, and requirements that are specific to the particular situation. A contract statement of work should be included in the official contract. This ensures that you will receive precisely what the sellers are bidding on.</p>

    <h3>Procurement or Bid Documents</h3>
    <p>Sellers need certain documents to be prepared during procurement planning. You will also have to determine criteria that will be used to evaluate each potential seller. Your team will likely use expert judgment and standard forms as the tools necessary to create relevant evaluation criteria and procurement documents. Request for proposal (RFP) and Request for quote (RFQ) documents are the two you will likely run into while managing projects. A request for proposal is a document which is used to solicit proposals from potential sellers. A proposal is the document that the seller prepares when there are several possible approaches to meeting the needs of a client. A request for quote, on the other hand, is a document which is used to solicit quotes, also known as bids, from sellers. A bid, also called a quote or tender, is another type of document that sellers prepare. This document is used to provide a price for clearly defined standard items to provide a buyer. A request for information (RFI) can also be used to get more information on the specifications of a seller’s products and services that will be acquired.</p>
    <p>Expertise is useful when writing a good RFP. Most people have never had to write or respond to an RFP in their career so talent in this task will make you stand out as a project manager. You can find examples of RFPs in many companies, potential contractors, and  government agencies. You should look at your RFP from the seller’s perspective to ensure it has the necessary information to make it good. You should consider whether or not the seller can develop a good proposal based on the information you provided in the RFP. You should also consider whether or not the seller can determine the pricing and schedule based on your RFP.</p>
    <p>The main sections of a RFP include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Statement of purpose</li>
      <li>Background information on your organization</li>
      <li>Basic requirements for goods and services to be proposed</li>
      <li>You organization’s hardware and software environment</li>
      <li>A solid description of the process of RFP</li>
      <li>Statement of work</li>
      <li>Schedule information</li>
      <li>Possible appendices</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your RFP could be between three and five pages long. However, large procurements may require RFPs that include hundreds of pages. It all depends on the size and complexity of the procurement.</p>
    <p>There are many terms used to describe RFPs and RFQs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Invitations for bid</li>
      <li>Invitations for negotiation</li>
      <li>Initial contractor responses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The name does not matter. You should make sure your  documents are written in a way that makes it fairly simple for potential sellers to be accurate and complete when creating proposals to send to your organization. All of your procurement documents must include a description of the preferred method of response, forms for pricing, and any provisions that are contractually required. The process of creating these documents must be rigorous to ensure consistent and comparable responses. These documents should also be flexible enough to allow sellers to make suggestions for better ways to satisfy your organization’s requirements.</p>
