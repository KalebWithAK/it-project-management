        <p class="text-title"><strong>Agile and adaptive environments</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;In an agile environment, the company uses and encourages Agile project management. The company or team
            enables others to use Agile methodologies to work effectively. There are many things that the Agile method
            supports and uses but the four main pillars or points that an Agile environment supports are collaboration
            and communication between anyone involved in the project, processes that are planned and constant
            improvement, continuous customer involvement, and finally an approach that is result oriented. An Agile
            environment uses all of these principles to create an Agile environment where the organization can succeed
            together.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Pillar 1: Collaboration and communication in an Agile environment</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The first pillar talks about collaboration and communication between members in an agile environment.
            This
            refers to the team members, and that all the members of a team are always aware of the progress that is
            happening during the project or if any errors and problems are showing up. Every team member has clear goals
            and clear instructions on what they need to achieve before their deadlines. If there are any
            misunderstandings, the team members are expected to speak up and address these issues for the team as a
            whole to move on together. The team members are also not in need of taking orders every single day from
            higher management to continue with their work as the team is organized and equipped with what they need to
            achieve. Every team member can communicate freely to achieve what they are expected to achieve. Something
            interesting about communication in an Agile environment is that companies that hire employees outside of
            their country are still able to continue this Agile methodology with free communication. With the epidemic
            that happened during 2020-2022, companies such as Zoom skyrocketed as that was the only way that previous
            employees that used to work in a building together are able to collaborate and communicate with each other.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Pillar 2: Planned progression and continuous improvement in an Agile
                environment</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The second pillar talks about the progression of the organization and how they are constantly
            improving as
            they progress through the project life cycle. The process that the organization follows is continual and
            understandable by the organization so it doesn’t seem unfair to any team members. Every team member in the
            organization, when working in an Agile environment has a work process that is distinct and designed to make
            sure every person is able to work to the best of their abilities in terms of agility, efficiency, and
            effectiveness. Not only are the work processes designed to be effective for each individual, but the team
            also chooses to take time, and have a retrospective on the work process and how it has worked for the team
            so far, and they choose to make decisions such as removing or adding certain steps to make the workflow more
            efficient while on the side addressing any problems that have shown up using their work process.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Pillar 3: Continuous customer involvement in an Agile environment</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;In an Agile environment, a very important attribute is constant customer involvement. This can be hard
            for
            certain other methodologies because the customer has many demands that the company cannot always produce as
            it might just be out of their hand to do so or is something that they cannot incorporate into their project
            in the future as that might affect other parts of the project instead. So either to save resources or save
            previously made parts of the project that were already made, continuous customer involvement might be more
            difficult to do. Although, in an Agile environment, the work processes are designed and built to withstand
            those customer needs and asks regardless of what point in the project it occurs. Teams that have an Agile
            environment can foresee these changes and can satisfy the customer interests and not have to put other parts
            of the project at risk. Due to the constant involvement of not just customers but also the stakeholders, an
            Agile environment will help the team incorporate the ideas of both parties with little to no difficulty
            because of the work process that is designed to help with that kind of adaptability.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Pillar 4: An approach that is result oriented in an Agile environment</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;An approach that is result oriented in an Agile environment means that rather than putting all the
            team's
            resources into producing as many projects as possible within the time limit, a result-oriented approach
            focuses more on producing quality and effective products that satisfy the customer needs rather than
            producing more products with lesser quality and doesn’t support all the customer needs. Rather than
            finishing a product and making another immediately start, the team chooses to have a retrospective on the
            previous outcomes of the last project to see if what they are doing is achieving the goals that they set out
            for themselves at the start. These decisions are made by looking at the results from the last project and
            not the opinions of team members or other stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;In conclusion, a project manager can use these four pillars of an Agile environment to create an
            environment
            where they will know what method of collaboration and communication they need to use to be successful.
            Project managers will be able to design a workflow that will be beneficial to each team member where they
            can adhere to the customers as well as the stakeholders. The project managers will be able to decipher what
            they expect the result to be, to that workflow that will be effective, and agile for the team members.
            Depending on the team structure, the project managers can result to different methods of collaboration, for
            example, either in-person meetings for morning meetings or face-to-face if that is more effective for the
            team. When creating that workflow, they will also have to account for the stakeholders and customers to make
            sure that the workflow is flexible enough to add those interests that will inevitably be brought to the team
            regardless of what time in the project life cycle. Finally, project managers can create a near close to
            perfect workflow that will be able to bring out the best in each team member as well as satisfy the
            customers and stakeholders. After the end of the workflow, the project managers can also reflect on how well
            that workflow worked and if there is anything that they can do better when designing the next workflow.
