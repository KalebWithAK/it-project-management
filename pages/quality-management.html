        <p class="text-title"><strong>What is Quality Management?</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Quality management is when an organization wants to ensure that all the products and services they
            offer are of their best quality. They ensure that they can keep the level of quality that they prefer for
            the company and their products to their customers. The organization and the agile teams do what they can
            within their power to make sure that they keep a steady level of quality within their products and services.
            There are many key components when it comes to quality management.

        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Key quality one: Quality Planning</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The first key quality of quality management is quality planning. Quality planning means that the
            organization meets to understand and identify the standards of quality that are needed for the project and
            decide the best approach to achieving that outcome.
        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Key quality two: Quality Improvement</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The second key quality of quality management is quality improvement. Quality improvement is when the
            organization meets to find a change that benefits the project and the quality of the project. They not only
            make sure that the quality of the project is better but also the reliability or success of that demanded
            quality to succeed.


        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Key quality three: Quality Control</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The third key quality of quality management is quality control. Quality control is when the
            organization meets to make sure that all the employees and workers that are working on the project are
            contributing to what they need to do and that they are upholding the integrity of the process to achieve the
            outcome that they desire.

        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Key quality four: Quality Assurance</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The fourth and final quality of quality management is quality assurance. Quality assurance is when the
            organization sets a number of standards and planned things to do to make sure that the reliability of the
            product or service they are trying to deliver will meet the requirements that the project manager set out to
            go with at the start.

        </p>

        <p class="text-title"><strong>Principles of Quality Management</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;There are many principles that are considered the standard for quality management. These principles
            are used by many project managers around the world to ensure their organization's success. These principles
            are also used by top management so that they can make sure that the organization's performance increases
            throughout the years.

        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Principle one: Customer Focus</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Customer focus is something that is important to any business or organization. This primary focus
            makes sure that a company can release products that are catered to their customers and this will benefit the
            company as a whole because when they release products that are catered to their customers, that will in
            return increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. This loyalty will then make sure that they invest in the
            company in the long run which will then give the company money in revenue. This business that makes sure
            customer focus is important to them also has better quality products and processes that are more efficient
            than their competitors.
        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Principle two: Leadership</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;A good leader in any group is a vital part of the team's success. In an organization, good leadership
            can make sure that the employees are staying motivated in what they are doing as well as many sure that the
            workforce works with a purpose. With a purpose, they will work more efficiently and also produce products
            that are of higher quality.
        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Principle three: Engagement of People</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Involvement of the whole organization and getting input from others and hearing other parties out is a
            principle that is very important to the success of a project. Making sure that all of your workforce,
            including the ones that are part-time and full-time, are working efficiently and are provided with
            everything they need will make sure that they succeed in what they are given to do. A project team would
            always encourage each other to make sure that they are giving their best in what they do as well as making
            sure that if they need help with anything that is personal they are able to get that help in the form of
            friendships or financial support.
        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Principle four: Process Approach</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Something that is crucial to the success of a project is the way that a project team approaches the
            project that they were given. The way that they approach can determine how efficiently they will be able to
            complete that project. Making sure that the approach goes over all the details and the workforce is given
            the resources that they need will make sure that they can decrease future cost spending as well as waste
            time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Principle five: Continuous Improvement</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Any organization that is working on a project should have a clear objective that they need to be
            working towards continuous improvement. If they are working in agile ways and doing sprints, they need to
            make sure that they are also doing retrospectives to make sure that they can improve from each sprint, and
            to do that they need to, from the start, have a clear continuous improvement objective.
        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Principle six: Evidence-based Decision Making</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Decision-making when it is based on assumptions is never going to always give you a positive response.
            When an organization starts making decisions that are based on evidence that has happened previously, then
            they will be able to analyze those mistakes and errors made from previous projects and they will ensure that
            they donâ€™t make those same mistakes again. With this, it will decrease the number of times unintended
            results appears.
        </p>
        <p class="text-title"><strong>Principle seven: Relationship Management</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Relationship management is something that a company can do as a whole where they are able to make
            relationships with not only the customers and stakeholders but also the suppliers and retailers that sell
            their products and services. When an organization begins to form relationships between its suppliers and
            retailers it will be able to optimize their impact and promote its products better as well. With that in
            mind when after forming this relationships the company will be able to increase its performance and also be
            able to manage the parties that are involved with its product which will also ensure that the customers are
            getting what they wanted and that will increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
