    <h2>Relation Between Quality Management and Scope Management</h2>

    <img src="../images/quality-control.jpeg">

    <p>
      Quality is a compilation of characteristics of an entity that make it possible 
      for it to satisfy needs that are either stated or implied. Quality can also be 
      defined as conformance to requirements. In other words, the project’s ability 
      to meet its written specifications. Fitness for use is another way to define 
      quality. Fitness for use is the ability of the product to be used as intended. 
      Project quality management is used to ensure that the project will meet the 
      client’s and users’ needs. As a project manager, it is your responsibility to 
      manage the quality of each iteration of the project to ensure that it meets 
      the client’s needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three main processes of quality management:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Planning quality management</li>
      <li>Managing quality</li>
      <li>Controlling quality</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Planning Quality</h3>
    <p>
      In the planning quality management process, you will identify requirements 
      and standards for the quality of the project. You will also discuss with your 
      team the most effective ways to meet these standards.
    </p>

    <p>In the managing quality process, you will translate the requirements and 
      standards found in quality management planning into actions and activities 
      that can be done by your team during the project’s execution. You will also 
      create quality reports, documents for testing and evaluation, change requests, 
      updates to the project management plan, and updates to the project’s documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the controlling quality process, you will monitor the specific results of 
      the project to ensure their completeness, accuracy, and ability to meet the 
      client’s expectations. This process uses many techniques and tools such as 
      Pareto charts, quality control charts, and statistical sampling. By controlling 
      quality, your team will output verified deliverables, work performance 
      information, change requests, updates to the project management plan, and 
      updates to the project’s documents.
    </p>

    <h3>Managing Quality</h3>
    <p>
      In order to plan quality management, you can design experiments to help 
      identify which variables have the greatest influence on the results of a 
      process within your project. Understanding the underlying factors that 
      influence the outcome of a process is important for developing good standards 
      of quality for your project. You must also communicate the correct actions to 
      ensure quality control in a complete and readable format.Your organization’s 
      standards for quality are important to include in your quality management 
      plan because your project must conform to the organizations standards. Your 
      quality management plan should address functionality, system outputs, 
      performance, reliability, maintainability.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Functionality is the system’s ability to perform its stated function. Features are characteristics that draw users to your product. You must ensure that these features achieve a high degree of functionality and accomplish specific goals within your project</li>
      <li>System outputs are the visible elements of the system. This includes screens and reports generated by the system. You must ensure that users can easily read these screens and the reports are in a format that is useful for your users.</li>
      <li>Performance deals with how well the product performs the intended use of the customer. To ensure a high level of performance you, your team, and the client must discuss the volumes of data and transactions that the system can manage, the number of simultaneous users, the projected rate of growth of users, the types of equipment on which the system will be deployed, as well as many other factors.</li>
      <li>Reliability is the ability of the product to perform as intended under normal conditions.</li>
      <li>Maintainability refers to how easy it is for future developers to fix or make adjustments to the software as needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </main>

  <h3>Controlling Quality</h3>
  <p>
    There are three primary aspects of controlling quality. These are acceptance 
    decisions, rework, and process adjustments.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Acceptance decisions are the process of choosing whether or not the module 
      of software will be accepted for integration into the system. If rejected, 
      the module will have to be reworked until it meets the quality requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rework is any action taken to redo work that was previously completed but 
      not up to your team’s or organizations quality standards.
    </li>
    <li>
      Process adjustments are corrective actions to ensure that quality problems 
      do not continue in the future. Process adjustments can change the project 
      management plan and your organization’s process assets.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are several tools at your disposal for quality control as a 
    project manager: cause and effect diagrams, control charts, checksheets, and 
    scatter diagrams.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A cause and effect diagram helps track complaints about quality to the responsible systems so these issues can be resolved at the source. You can use the 5 whys technique, where you ask roughly five questions to peel back the layers and reveal the root cause of an issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      A control chart is a visual representation of the results of processes as time progresses. You can assess whether a process is in control or out of control via the use of a control chart. If a process is in control, it likely does not need to be adjusted. However, processes that are out of control likely require changes. Variations in the results of a process are caused by nonrandom events. It is your responsibility to track down these events and find their common cause. This will allow you to change the process at the source of its issues and create a more predictable result. There is a rule that states that a process should be examined if seven data points in a row are all below or above the mean. This rule is called the seven run rule.
    </li>
    <li>
      A checksheet is a checklist or tally sheet which can be used to collect data about a process.
    </li>
    <li>
      A scatter diagram can assist with showing a relationship between variables of a process. Data points are more closely related if the corresponding data points are closer to a diagonal line.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How quality management relates to scope management</h3>
  <p>
    Scope management relates to quality management because an increase in scope will increase the number of features that need to be assessed for quality. Additionally, problems with quality in features implemented earlier in the software’s development will compound as they affect later features. As a project manager, it is vital for you to address these issues earlier in the development cycle.
