    <p>What does the term “project cost management” mean? What makes it so important in the topic of Agile project management? What are the concepts that this topic introduces? If you are reading this, you are either a project manager working with Agile methodologies or you are an aspiring project manager. You want to further your knowledge in Agile project management and strive to be the best project manager you can be. These questions will be answered as the topic of project cost management is explained in a detailed overview.</p>
    
    <h3>What is Cost?</h3>
    <p>Before we dive into the meaning of project cost management, we must first understand what cost is. Cost is defined as a particular item that is given up in exchange for another item. Cost is most often measured in monetary terms in a form of currency in exchange for products or services. How does this relate to project management? Projects cost money and resources that can be implemented in different places. This means that project managers must understand how to manage costs in a given project, therefore coining the term “project cost management.”</p>

    <h3>The Meaning of Project Cost Management</h3>
    <p>With cost being defined in the previous paragraph, project cost management takes in all of the processes necessary to make sure that the project development team completes a given project within a certain approved budget. It is imperative that project managers ensure that the projects they oversee are well defined, have accurate estimates on cost and time during the project, and have a realistic budget that the project manager was involved in approving for the project. </p>
    <p>You, as a project manager, are responsible for making the project stakeholders happy while mitigating costs where necessary. It is good to know one major side effect of not practicing project cost management effectively–cost overrun. It’s the additional monetary amount by which the actual costs of the project go over the estimates. Now you understand the meaning of project cost management and why it is important to practice it effectively. </p>

    <h3>The Processes Involved in Project Cost Management</h3>

    <p>There are four major processes involved in the concept of project cost management that we will touch in a high-level overview:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Planning cost management - deciding the documentation, steps, and policies to be utilized for controlling, planning, and executing the costs of a given project. A cost management plan is the main output of this process.</li>
        <li>Estimating costs - creating an estimation of the resource costs necessary to finish a given project. Basis of estimates, project documents, and activity cost estimates updates are all outputs of this specific process. </li>
        <li>Determining the budget - setting cost estimates to specific work items to form a standard to measure execution within the project. Cost baselines, project documentation updates, and funding requirements for the project are all outputs of this specific process.</li>
        <li>Controlling costs - managing the changes to the budget of the project. Work execution information, forecasts of costs, requests of change, and plan updates are all main outputs of this specific process.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now that we have discussed what project cost management is and described how it works by listing its main processes, it is time to mention the basic principles of project cost management. These principles are not exclusive to agile project management, but project managers should know how these principles can be applied to their projects.</p>
    
    <h3>The Basic Principles of Project Cost Management</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Profits: These are defined as revenues minus expenses. In order to make more profit, a company or business can make more revenue, lower costs, or even attempt doing the two at once. Most leadership members in these organizations are concerned with profits more than anything else. As an Agile project manager, you should be concerned about the impact on profits, not just focusing on increasing revenue or decreasing expenses. It is not possible to examine the potential pros of a given product without knowledge of the profit margin. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Profit margin: This is the measure of profitability within an organization. For example, if your company has a revenue of $200 and generates $6 in profit, then there is a 3% profit margin. This also goes vice versa; if your company generates a revenue of $200 but loses $6, then a -3% profit margin is calculated.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Life cycle costing: This gives a high level overview of cost within a given project throughout its development, or life cycle. In doing so, this will assist project managers develop a good prediction of a project's benefits and costs financial wise. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Cash flow analysis: This is a method utilized for determining the predicted yearly costs and benefits for a given project and the resulting yearly cash flow. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Tangible costs: Typically measured monetarily.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Intangible costs: Pretty hard to measure monetarily
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Direct costs: Costs that are related directly to producing the deliverables of a given project.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Indirect costs: Costs not related directly to producing the deliverables of a given project. They are also not related directly with the work performance on the project.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Sunk cost: This is money that has already been spent in the past.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Learning curve theory: This theory states that when a lot of items are produced repetitively, the unit cost of such items are lowered in a regular trend as more units are made. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Reserves: This is defined as dollar amounts included in an estimate of costs to decrease the cost risk by giving clearance for future situations that can be difficult to predict.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Contingency reserves (“Known unknowns”): Allow for future situations that can be partially planned for and are a part of the project cost baseline.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Management reserves (“Unknown unknowns”): These reserves allow for unpredictable future situations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In summary, Agile project managers should know how to manage costs of a given project throughout its lifetime. Project managers should familiarize themselves with the processes of project cost management and follow along its basic principles to effectively stay within budget during a project’s life cycle and prevent the dangerous side effects of cost overruns. All of this information will be used to not only meet the budget goals of a project, but also satisfy the stakeholders that are also involved with the project. Remember to not just focus on making profits, but also looking at the impacts of those profits. </p>
