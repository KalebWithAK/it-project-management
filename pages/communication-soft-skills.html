    <p>
      Communication is one of the most important factors for ensuring the success of your IT project. One of the greatest challenges that projects that fail face is a lack of effective communication between team members, project managers, business associates, and stakeholders. Other knowledge areas can be negatively impacted by poor communication. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unclear scope</li>
      <li>Unrealistic schedules</li>
      <li>Budgeting issues</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Due to the changing nature of technology, there is a lot of technical language that is constantly being developed and popularized by the industry. Technical jargon can complicate communication when speaking with business professionals and stakeholders. As a project manager, it is your responsibility to translate between the technical jargon and a more simplified version of language that can be understood by the less technically knowledgeable members of the project. The gap in knowledge between programmers and regular users widens at a rapid pace as technology advances. Your role is to close this gap as best you can to ensure that everyone involved with the project can be on the same page. Stereotypically, programmers are not the best at communicating this technical information to people outside of the tech industry. Although this stereotype is not necessarily true, everyone can benefit from improving their communication skills.</p>

    <p>Most education programs for computer science and other computing related degrees have many technical requirements that students must master before they can graduate. However, a lot of these programs do not put as much emphasis on improving the communication skills of their students. Courses that could improve communication include speaking, psychology, writing, listening, the humanities,,as well as sociology. These soft skills are extremely important to develop but most people assume that it does not take as much work to become an effective communicator. Studies have found that soft skills are just as important as technical skills for IT professionals. In the industry, there is an increasing demand for graduates with communication and business skills on top of the expected technical proficiency. According to the International Journal of Business and Social Science:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Organizations want applicants with a mix of soft, technical, and business skills.</li>
      <li>Teamwork, problem solving, listening, adaptability to new languages and technologies, proper management of time, being able to transition from knowledge to application, the ability to handle a multitude of tasks, verbal communication skills, visualization and conceptualization, interpersonal skills, understanding the culture of business, inter-team communication, and receive as well as give criticism that is constructive.</li>
      <li>Soft skills are in such high demand in companies that they will hire candidates that meet the minimum requirements for technical skills as long as they demonstrate a mastery of soft skills.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal of your communication in a software development project should be to ensure timely and appropriate creation, collection, dissemination, storing, and disposing of information about the project. The three main processes you will encounter in project communications management are planning communications management, managing communications, and monitoring communications.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Planning communications management is the process of figuring out the communication and informational needs of stakeholders. This process outputs the project communications plan, project management plan updates, and project document updates.</li>
      <li>Managing communications is the process of creating, distributing, storing, retrieving, and disposing of information communicated about the project according to the communications management plan. This process outputs project communications, project management plan updates, project document updates, and updates to organizational process assets.</li>
      <li>Monitoring communications is the process of ensuring the needs of the stakeholder are met as they relate to communications.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You will spend roughly 90 percent of your time communicating with others as a project manager. It is difficult to understand people and their motivations. It is equally difficult to effectively communicate with people. There are a number of concepts related to improving communication including presenting news in a timely manner and in a way that is effective, setting the appropriate environment for communicating bad news, using both formal and informal methods of communication, focusing on communication needs of individuals and the group, and understanding the multiple communication channels.</p>

    <p>You cannot add more personnel to a project that is already behind schedule as that will not solve the problem. This approach will likely create more problems because of the increase in the complexity of communications. As a project manager, you cannot make the assumption that two people will be able to complete a task in half the amount of time it will take one person to complete that same task. Different people have different preferences on communication. Take receiving praise, for example. An extrovert would likely appreciate receiving their praise for a job well done in front of the rest of the team. An introvert, on the other hand, would likely prefer to receive their praise in private. People who are more inclined to sensing would rather have clear details that are drawn out step by step, while an intuitive individual would rather be given details of how their task fits into the bigger picture. Strong thinkers want to know as much information as possible, while feeling people want to know the impact on other people as well as themselves. A perceiving person may need more help with following and developing plans, while a judging person would automatically be extremely driven to meet deadlines with minimal reminders. Every individual on your team will be unique, so you cannot assume that you can communicate with them the exact same way.</p>

    <p>You must seek to understand before you provide information. Put yourself in your team membersâ€™ shoes before attempting to communicate with them. It is important for everyone on your team to be aware of their individual communication styles. It is also extremely important for you, as a project manager, to understand the different communication styles present on your team as well as how to adjust your communication to best accommodate each individual with whom you are conversing. Most IT professionals are typically more introverted, intuitive, and more oriented to thinking in contrast to feeling. These differences in personality can potentially lead to miscommunication when encountering people with the personality traits of feeling, extraverted, and sensation oriented. For example, a user guide written by a programmer may not include all the step by step instructions that are needed by users. Many users may also prefer short videos or a face to face interaction to learn the intricacies of a system as opposed to a written guide.</p>
