    <h2>How Project Management Software Assists With Project Cost Management</h2>

    <img src="../images/project-management-software-budget.jpeg">

    <p>
      Creating the budget for your agile project is a critical task as an agile 
      project manager. It helps your team assess the costs associated with the 
      development and deployment of the project and determine whether the project’s 
      completion is feasible given the cost constraints of your client. This is a 
      daunting task in agile project development because there are many tasks that 
      must be estimated in order to build an accurate budget for the project. 
      Additionally, in an agile project, the requirements and scope can change over 
      time which adds further variability in your budget. Project management software 
      can assist you in developing the budget for your agile software project by 
      offering resources as well as features that make it easier to track and manage 
      the costs and expenses of the project for the entire course of its completion. 
    </p>
    <p>There are several ways that project management software can simplify making a budget:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resource Planning</li>
      <li>Time Tracking</li>
      <li>Agile Budgeting</li>
      <li>Reporting and Analytics</li>
      <li>Collaboration</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Resource Planning</h3>
    <p>
      Assigning resources to specific tasks and projects is an important part of 
      planning the budget. Project management software provides resource management 
      tools that simplify this process and make it more manageable. As an agile 
      project manager, you can utilize the software’s tools to estimate resource 
      costs, such as labor and equipment, required to complete the project 
      efficiently. The budget can then be made according to these estimations. 
      Resource management tools help to organize this process and can keep track of 
      resources as new ones are added later in the project’s development.
    </p>

    <h3>Time Tracking</h3>
    <p>
      Software for agile projects can help track the time required to complete 
      certain tasks in the project development life cycle. This can help you 
      estimate the remaining time for the project based on the remaining incomplete 
      tasks of the project. This can be factored into the budget to estimate the 
      cost per hour of certain services and resources. Time tracking tools provided 
      by agile project management software can also be used as a template for future 
      projects that are similar to the current one. Since certain tasks will be 
      similar from project to project, the estimated time to complete these tasks 
      will likely also be similar. This can help make a more accurate estimation for 
      future projects because there is documentation of the time and costs required 
      to complete certain tasks.
    </p>

    <h3>Agile Budgeting</h3>
    <p>
      One of the main factors in agile projects management is the fact that 
      requirements change constantly. This is one of the biggest challenges you 
      will face as a project manager. Project management software can help 
      alleviate this problem by keeping track of the estimated costs and making 
      changes to the budget as new requirements are added later in the project’s 
      life cycle. Project management software can take into account changes in 
      scope as well as unknown costs that spring up during development. Project 
      management software can also help keep you organized so you can keep track 
      of all of these changes in one place. The flexibility of the software allows 
      you to make changes whenever they eventually arise. 
    </p>

    <h3>Reporting and Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      Project management software is extremely useful in creating reports for the 
      projects. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Financial Reports</li>
      <li>Cost Analysis</li>
      <li>Budget Summaries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These reports provide a clear reference of the financial status of the 
      project. This can be used in making financial decisions throughout the 
      course of the project’s planning and development phases. These reports can be 
      generated automatically which gives you more time to spend on other areas of 
      the project. Reports being generated by project management software gives you 
      more time to complete other tasks associated with the project. One of the 
      biggest advantages of using project management software is the amount of time 
      it saves you as a project manager by automating some of the more tedious 
      tasks. Reports created by project management software can also be used to 
      more accurately reflect the costs of similar projects that you will manage 
      in the future.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>
      Project management software also supports collaboration within your team, 
      business partners, and your client. This helps ensure that everyone involved 
      in the project’s planning, development, and deployment are on the same page 
      when it comes to project costs. Instead of having to manually send members of 
      the team reports or estimates, they can simply refer to the project management 
      software to get an idea of what is going on. This is especially useful when 
      communicating with the client because they have a full picture of the costs 
      associated with their product. They can then revise requirements or decrease 
      the scope if costs are getting out of hand. Everyone having access to the same 
      information is crucial for effective communication between people involved in 
      the project. Your team members can also provide more accurate estimates for 
      the time required to complete specific tasks that they are assigned based on 
      their experience in the role. Having the ability to collaborate with the team 
      using project management software gives them the ability to share those estimates. 
      This creates less work for you because as a project manager, you can just 
      review and revise your team members’ estimates rather than creating them 
      from scratch. If anyone is unsure about the remaining workload and costs 
      associated with each task, they can simply refer to the project management 
      software to get a better understanding.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Determining a budget is important for managing all kinds of projects, however, Agile projects can change requirements and scope so the budget must be flexible.</li>
      <li>Project management software can simplify the process of creating an accurate budget while also keeping your project’s financial status organized and clear over its life cycle.</li>
      <li>Project management software is useful for resource planning using a bottom up approach of estimating the time and costs associated with each individual task and using these estimates to determine the cost of the project.</li>
      <li>Project management software is useful for time tracking to estimate the time to complete a task and use that information to more accurately estimate the time required to complete similar projects in the future.</li>
      <li>Project management software excels at budgeting in an agile project because new costs can be accounted for and factored into the budget at any time during the project’s development.</li>
      <li>Project management software can also create automated reports which can be used to adjust the budget, requirements, and scope if necessary. These reports can be used to communicate with your client and business professionals in your organization. Reports generated by project management software can paint a clear picture of the project’s financial position and can be used to estimate similar projects in the future.</li>
      <li>Another strength of project management software is collaboration. Everyone involved in the project can be on the same page when it comes to understanding information about the project’s costs and budget because multiple people can collaborate using project management software. This also helps decrease your workload as a project manager because you can review and revise your team member’s estimates rather than guessing yourself.</li>
