    <h2>Modern Project Team Communication</h2>

    <p>Communication is a vital skill in any project or facet of a workplace. Although the importance of clear and
      effective communication is conspicuous, one finds people focusing more on technical skill development than
      communication improvement. Thus, it is not hard to find teams of highly qualified technical experts having trouble
      communicating and causing strain on the progress of a project. Some people are gifted with great communication,
      while others have great technical prowess. Since both of those types of skills are important in a project, one
      must develop both kinds of skills to improve their productivity in a project/work environment. </p>
    <p>Now that we know that communication skills should not be taken for granted, let’s look at how we can improve
      communications within a project.</p>

    <h3>Effective Meetings</h3>
    <p>Meetings are an important part of any team for introducing important aspects of a project, sharing updates,
      brainstorming ideas and much more. However, you must have heard of someone complaining about how a certain meeting
      was unnecessary and a waste of time. To ensure their effectiveness, it is important that meetings are productive
      and held in a timely manner. Remember, the time that people spend in a meeting is time they spend away from work,
      doing something productive. Therefore, consideration and effort need to be placed into holding effective meetings.
      Let’s discuss some strategies for determining if a meeting is effective.</p>

    <h4>Can this meeting be avoided?</h4>
    <p>Meetings should be held when there is a need for collaboration and communication. If the meeting is not being
      held for planning, decision-making, problem-solving, or other productive purposes, it should really be
      reconsidered. Ask questions like, can the information being relayed in this meeting be conveyed just as easily
      through an email, text message or letter? How urgent and important is the matter? Determining the right medium to
      convey the necessary information is as essential part of communication. Therefore, choose wisely and do not be
      afraid to cancel a meeting if it takes away from the overall productivity of the project team.</p>

    <h4>What is this meeting specifically about?</h4>
    <p>Meetings need to be for a specific purpose and the resolution that is expected to be reached at the meeting
      should be clearly defined. Ask questions like should this meeting be about brainstorming ideas or is it about
      tackling a specific problem? Try to make the purpose of the meeting as clear as possible, so that all attendees
      are prepared and focused on what needs to be communicated. Without a clear purpose, attendees may be confused as
      to why this meeting was called and may be underprepared, thus taking up precious time and productivity./p>

    <h4>Who should be attending?</h4>
    <p>It is important to consider who needs to be at the meeting. Is this meeting being called to discuss a technical
      bug problem with a certain part of the software? Then the meetings should only be held by the software engineers
      pertinent to that problem. Determine if the meeting purpose is relevant to someone attending and choose only those
      who should attend based on the purpose and needs of the meeting.</p>

    <h4>"Where do we start?" Meeting Agendas</h4>
    <p>Design an agenda for the meeting and provide it to attendees. A meeting agenda lists what will be gone over
      during the meeting and the pre-requisites of attending that meeting. Chances are that after reading the agenda,
      certain people may choose not to attend the meeting as it is not relevant to them. Furthermore, an agenda helps
      attendees come prepared so that meeting is more effective. This also saves time as the more effective a meeting
      is, the less there is a need for more meetings. </p>

    <h4>"Where did they say the meeting was?" Logistical Arrangments and Visual Aids</h4>
    <p>Make the necessary arrangements for a meeting in advance and communicate that information as early as possible.
      This ensures that the logistics of a meeting do not become a challenge for the attendees as they have an ample
      amount of time to plan around it. Make sure you make use of effective visual aids to convey vital information
      during the meeting, such as PowerPoints, charts, and handouts.</p>

    <h4>Professionalism and Cod of Conduct</h4>
    It is important that the meeting takes place in a professional manner. There are different ways to run a meeting and
    it helps the attendees to know how the meeting will be run. For example, if the meeting will allow one speaker at a
    time and if attendees are free to interject at any given moment. As important as it is to maintain a professional
    environment, it is important to build good relationships between the team members. Therefore, appropriate humor,
    snacks and refreshments, and fun activities are all recommended as ways to build relationships between attendees.
    You may choose to create a code of conduct and relay it to all participants so they have an idea of what to expect.
    That also allows you hold those accountable who violate the code of conduct.

    <h3>Improving Communication with Technology</h3>
    <p>There are many technologies out there to help teams communicate with each other, however, it is uncommon to see
      any training being given on communication technologies, such as email. Why is it assumed that most people already
      know the sometimes complex but powerful technological features available in communication? Although the basic
      features of the ubiquitous communication technologies are well known, new features are often added to new updates
      of these technologies. Therefore, users need to be trained in how to best use these new features to improve their
      productivity. Indeed, saving just a few minutes of work can add up to hours being saved at the end of the year and
      thus, increase overall productivity considerably.</p>

    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <p>For many people, writing performance reports, creating presentations and other forms of project communications
      are new and they may struggle to start or ask for help. Therefore, in order to streamline the process, standard
      templates can be created for those project communications. These templates can be based off previous successful
      project communication documents. </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, communication is a vital part of any project and should not be taken for granted. Effective
      meetings, the use of communication technologies, and standardized templates are all effective ways to improve
      communication within a project team. By utilizing these strategies, a project manager can streamline communication
      and enhance the productivity of their team. Remember that clear communication is the key to success in any
      project, and investing time and effort into improving communication skills will lead to better outcomes in the
      long run.</p>
