        <h2>Benefits of Agile Methodology</h2>

            <p><strong>What is Agile?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Agile is a methodology that is used in project management and software development. This methodology is
                an approach that can help teams take many iterative and incremental steps that can help create a project.
                These
                iterative and incremental steps are all short-term and produce a prototype after each cycle. During each
                cycle, there also will be more innovations for the project that makes each feature more efficient. There
                are
                many benefits to using the Agile methodology in a team setting.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>How does Agile reduce risks?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The first benefit is that it reduces a lot of risks. When a team is applying the Agile method, the theory is
            that it will never fail. When a project team is using Agile, they will be taking many small cycles called
            sprints where at the end of each sprint they deliver an unfinished product. With this in mind, the project
            will never fail and there are fewer risks taken because when you finish one sprint, you do a retrospective
            of what went well and what went wrong, with that information you can work more efficiently on the next
            sprint and reduce the number of risks and the chance for failure
        </p>

        <p><strong>How does Agile increase customer satisfaction?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The second benefit is that there will be an increase in customer satisfaction. When creating a product one
            of the most if not the most important thing is for the product to satisfy the customer. This is why Agile
            methodology includes customers in their decision-making process. By including customers in their
            decision-making process, they are able to understand what the product lacks and where they need to improve.
            Another way the customers are involved is when the company creates prototypes or demos for the customer to
            try and give feedback, with this feedback the product only becomes more efficient.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How does Agile increase adaptability?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The third benefit of using Agile is increased adaptability. This means that when a company uses a
            methodology like a waterfall, they start with the planning and stick with that planning for the rest of the
            project. This hinders the project because if there were new innovations that come out, then the waterfall
            method would not be able to adapt those new innovations since in the planning phase those innovations were
            not involved. When it comes to Agile since thereâ€™s a cycle, once a sprint is done, in the next sprint you
            can incorporate those new innovations into that sprint which can not only save a lot of time and resources
            but also make the project more up to date if there are any needs to update in the future.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How does Agile increase team morale?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The fourth benefit of using Agile is that it improves team morale. In Agile you are required to do sprint
            meetings with your project team, there are daily sprint meetings that happen at the start of the day to
            discuss what is done and what has to be done. During these meetings, the team members get to interact with
            each other and they learn and grow together due to these interactions, the team is much closer to each other
            and they are able to discuss any problem they have with their work and have a strong understanding that if
            they need help they have people that can help them. With this in mind, the team morale when is always strong
            and the productivity of the team is very efficient.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How does Agile increase the quality of the product?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The fifth benefit is that there is an increase in product quality when using Agile methodology. This goes
            back to how adaptable the Agile method is, when you keep doing this iterative process, the team together
            grows and learns more skills that will help with the project, and because it is an iterative process you can
            include those new skills to make the project work more efficiently. With each sprint, the team produces a
            kind of prototype that will have a lot of functionality that the final product will. Over many sprints, the
            quality of the product will only increase because there will be many additional innovations that will be
            talked about in the retrospective of each sprint. Other team members can also pitch in and share their
            thoughts and ideas to better the product in the next sprint. With this in mind, the product will only
            progress forwards rather than having many setbacks. The Agile method is made so that those setbacks that the
            team members can experience during the sprints will be brought up at the end of the sprint and can be
            discussed to fix the upcoming sprint by the other team members.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How does Agile increase visibility between the CEO and their teams?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The sixth benefit of the Agile methodology is increased visibility. All increased visibility means that in a
            company/organization, the leaders of the company are able to see and know what is going on for each project
            management group and see if they have any feedback or inputs to give. In many organizations/companies,
            visibility is very important because the CEO or the leaders of the company are the ones making the
            decisions, and then the teams working for that company follow. When the leaders know what is going on, what
            is being worked on, and what will be worked on, the company's leadership will increase and the organization
            as a whole will be more strategic and coordinated. Everyone in the company will be able to benefit from this
            attribute since the leader will be able to make decisions that not only benefit the company but each and
            every individual that works for the company to make their upcoming projects successful.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What are the main concepts of Agile?</strong></p>
        <p>
            All of the benefits listed will serve helpful to any company that adopts the Agile and methodology. When
            Agile is put into practice, the company as a whole will be able to benefit from its concepts. These concepts
            in Agile are mainly based on things like bettering quality, constantly improving the project in every
            iteration, and being flexible to the changes that happen within and outside of the company, in terms of
            technological improvements and the transparency where people from the CEO of the company to the customers of
            the product all know what is going on during these projects. The Agile methodology makes it so that the
            customers can test out the product and give feedback, all while involving the CEO so they can make smarter
            decisions that will only benefit the company as a whole.
