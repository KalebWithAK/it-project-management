        <h2>Agile Vs Waterfall: Which methodology to choose?</h2>

        <p>So, you have got a team project and are planning to
            start working on it when you run into the decision
            of choosing which project management methodology
            you should use. Although there are many choices
            to choose from, the two popular choices are Agile
            and Waterfall. When it comes to deciding which
            methodology to choose from for your project,
            the choice is not always simple, since one will
            perform better for certain projects than others.
            Then how can one decide which one to use?
            In order to answer that question, we need to dive
            deeper into each methodology.</p>

        <h3>The Waterfall Methodology</h3>
        <p>The waterfall methodology is more traditional
            and linear approach to project development,
            where the flow of the project stages is sequential
            and pre-determined. Waterfall is one of the
            original methods employed for projects. The method
            requires that all the project requirements and
            constraints are known from the beginning, before
            the project even starts. The Project Manager
            takes communicates with the users and the client
            to create a detailed understanding of the requirements of the project. Then, the project flows “down”
            different project phases includes requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance, in a
            sequence. </p>


        <h4>The waterfall methodology comes with its advantages, that include:</h4>

        <ul>Errors in design are caught before moving onto the software phase, thus saving time.</ul>
        <ul>Documentation is very easy and simple.</ul>
        <ul>The different stages of the methodology are pre-defined and easy to understand.</ul>
        <ul>Since requirements are already specified, testing and cost evaluation is much easier</ul>

        <h4>However, its not without its limits:</h4>

        <ul>Clients do not fully understand what they want. They may find it difficult to explain what they want or
            genuinely not know what they need until they see the application.</ul>
        <ul>It is very difficult and expensive to make changes to the application down the road.</ul>
        <ul>Once requirements are established in the beginning, there is not changing them.</ul>
        <ul>The project can take longer to deliver as all stages must be completed before the application can be ready.
        </ul>

        <p>It was due to these challenges with the Waterfall methodology, that new alternatives started emerging, with
            one of the most popular choices being the Agile methodology.</p>

        <h3>Agile Methodologies</h3>
        <p>An Agile methodology is an iterative form of project management, where the project is divided
            into “sprints”. Indeed, this methodology allows for changes in requirements throughout the life
            of the application as more information and feedback is received. A small part of conceptualizing,
            designing, developing and maintenance is included in every sprint. This also allows for a “minimum viable
            product” to be delivered, which is a pre-mature yet usable implementation of the application. This means
            that the project can be completed quicker as changes can easily be introduced in the next sprint. </p>

        <h4>Types of Agile Methodologies</h4>
        <p>There are many different kinds of Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, Extreme Programming and Test-Driven
            Development, which are more popular than others. </p>

        <h5>Scrum:</h5>
        <p>Scrum, originally a rugby term abbreviated from scrummage, is a kind of methodology which makes use of
            stopping and restarting the project “sprints”. It has fairly short development cycles, commonly around 30
            days. The output of each cycle should be a deliverable.</p>

        <h5>Extreme Programming:</h5>
        <p>Although extreme programming sounds like a programmer may be required to have an adrenaline rush while
            programming, its not so. Extreme programming is a highly change-based programming approach. A pair of
            programmers work together on implementing customer specifications early on. Then, the application is put
            through tests derived from the customer to see if it is satisfactory. Requirements determining is not as
            significant as requirements can easily be changed later on. It also dedicates a refactoring stage to make
            sure the code is free of unwanted functions that may be obsolete or otherwise not useful.</p>

        <h5>Test-Driven Development:</h5>
        <p>Test-driven development relies on tests to be written first before any actual production code. This means
            that when production code is written, the tests will fail any improper code immediately, and the code will
            be returned to be fixed. Like other Agile methodologies, the project is broken into short stages. This
            allows for more efficient and robust code, even though it may take more time as other agile approaches,
            since tests need to be designed before development. Also, code fixes during the new development period are
            easier to implement than if they were pushed during maintenance.</p>

        <h4>Agile methodologies gained popularity thanks to their benefits, such as:</h4>
        <ul>Much more flexible: allow for changes to occur early and later on without a high cost.</ul>
        <ul>Speeds up development: allows the delivery of a product to be done earlier on and uses feedback to improve
            requirements.</ul>
        <ul>More feedback means that there is a lesser risk of project failure.</ul>
        <ul>Promotes innovation.</ul>

        <h4>Some issues surrounding the Agile approach are:</h4>
        <ul>Unclear requirements. The requirements are ever changing throughout the project process.</ul>
        <ul>It may not be the best for larger projects.</ul>
        <ul>It allows for process and communication conflicts.</ul>

        <h3>Now that you are acquainted with the aforementioned methodologies, how do you decide what to choose? </h3>
        <p>We observe that for a given project, where one methodology lacks, another methodology has the potential to
            excel. The advantages and disadvantages of Waterfall and Agile methodologies is what helps determine which
            methodology to use in a given project. Larger, more distributed projects will benefit from using the
            Waterfall methodology, since Agile methodologies are weak for larger projects. Meanwhile, Agile projects
            will work wonderfully for relatively smaller projects, and better allow for innovation. If the requirements
            are well known in the beginning of the project, the Waterfall method may be a better option. On the other
            hand, if requirements are not well defined in the beginning, an Agile approach would be the way to go.</p>

                methodologies.</figcaption>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Since in the world of project management there is no such methodology that is “one size fit all”, there are a
            variety of methodologies available to choose from, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
            Therefore, in order to choose between Waterfall and Agile, all aspects of the project must be evaluated to
            determine which methodology suits it.</p>
