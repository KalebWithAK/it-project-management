    <h2>Activities: The Basis of Developing a Project Schedule</h2>
    <p>By Kaleb Dean</p>

    <p>As an agile project manager, activities will make your schedule development process a lot easier. This article will help you understand the importance of activities as the basis of developing project schedules by answering the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are activities in agile project management?</li>
      <li>How can activities be used as the basis of project schedule management?</li>
      <li>How is workflow conducted without activities?</li>
      <li>How is workflow improved with activities?</li>
      <li>How do activities make better schedules?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are activities in agile project management?</h3>
    <p>An activity is the smallest functional component of a project management plan. Activities are made up of smaller tasks. These tasks usually need to be completed in a specific order, although this is not always the case. Another term for project activity is a deliverable. In agile, these activities need to be able to integrate with the system but be fully functional. Using this blog site for example, the home page was the first activity. It needed to be accessible and have the necessary components to display article previews within cards. Another activity in the schedule for this blog was to include a search functionality. This needed to be fully functional by the start of sprint 0 but also needed to interact with the rest of the site. The other activities included styling and writing as well as posting the articles every week. These articles are functional on their own but mesh together with the rest of the site to build the entirety of the blog.</p>

    <h3>How can activities be used as the basis of project schedule management?</h3>
    <p>Activities are used as the basis of project schedule management by creating blocks of associated work that can be estimated individually. These defined activities can then be ordered based on priority and dependencies. For example, our team had to determine how to host this blog before we could build the homepage. We also had to build the homepage before the template for articles because the style of the articles were dependent on the styling of the homepage. Additionally, we had to create a template for the articles before writing each article to create a consistent style. All of these activities helped break down the overall task of “create a blog site for project managers” into bite-sized segments that could be completed in the required amount of time.</p>

    <h3>How is workflow without activities?</h3>
    <p>Without project activities, the workflow has the potential to be more disorganized. This is due to the fact that there will be so many small tasks for the team to complete, it will be hard to organize them in a way that can be easily estimated. This can be a problem when communicating with the client or members of the business side of your organization because they want clear timeframes of when to expect results. Additionally, without activities, agile is not possible. One of the key pillars of agile development is developing fully functional increments of software. Activities are the plans of those fully functional increments as well as any actions necessary to ensure those sections are able to be completed. For example, if any resources need to be procured from another team or organization, this would be an activity. Without activities, the workflow is more disorganized and harder to estimate.</p>

    <h3>How is workflow improved with activities?</h3>
    <p>With activities, the schedule is a bit easier to create and estimate. Instead of trying to estimate the total length of unorganized tasks, using activities provides a total estimated time it will take to complete the project by calculating the sum of the duration of all activities associated. Additionally, dependencies between project activities can be more clearly mapped out after said activities are defined. For example, the styling could not be completed until our team decided where to host the site. In this case, the styling activity was dependent on the website hosting activity.</p>

    <h3>How do activities make better schedules?</h3>
    <p>Activities make better schedules because they map out the predicted workflow of the project. As mentioned above, dependencies between activities can be determined which creates better schedules because you will have an idea of the order in which deliverables need to be completed. Being able to estimate chunks of the project creates better schedules because you as a project manager, the business professionals in your organization, and the client will have a better understanding of the predicted timeframe of the overall project. Activities also make better schedules because when something goes wrong and the completion of an activity is delayed, the schedule can better reflect how this will impact the start and finish dates of other activities and therefore the entire project. Additionally, a schedule with activities can be modified easier when new requirements arise.</p>
  
    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Activities in Agile project management are the actions that need to be taken to get resources for the project and the deliverables that function as the building blocks of the planned software product.</li>
      <li>Activities can be used as the basis of project schedule management by providing blocks of work that can be more easily estimated. Activities can be grouped based on relation to one another. The overall estimated completion date of the project can be calculated by taking the sum of the estimated time to complete all the project activities while taking into consideration their dependencies on one another.</li>
      <li>Project workflow without the use of activities is more unorganized and can lead to unrealistic estimates.</li>
      <li>Project workflow with the use of activities is more organized and leads to more accurate estimates because the dependencies between activities can be accounted for. Additionally, a schedule with activities can more easily reflect delays in one activity and how that will affect the release of other activities as well as completion date of the project overall.</li>
      <li>Activities make better schedules because they map out the predicted workflow of the project by breaking it down into smaller components. These components can be organized based on their relationships and put into chronological order easier than a schedule without activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As an agile project manager, developing an accurate schedule is critically important for communication with business professionals in your organization and your client. Defining activities within your project and organizing them to create a schedule is extremely effective in agile development because of the modularity they provide. This is vital when working in agile methodology because of the constantly changing requirements.</p>
