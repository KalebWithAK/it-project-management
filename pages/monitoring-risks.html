        <p><strong>What does monitoring risks mean for agile project management?</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;To start with, project risk means that it is the chance that the project will not be able to or fail
            to meet the objectives that were set for the team to complete. When thinking about project management,
            something that everyone needs to understand is that there will always be risks no matter how easy or hard
            the project objectives are. This is important because if there are risks and the risks are not managed well,
            then that means that there is a chance that, that risk might endanger not only the team members but also the
            entire organization.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why is monitoring risks important for an agile project management team?</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Something that is very important to understand is that realizing risks are something that you cannot
            control and they are something that will happen because of something out of your control failing. Due to
            this reason, risks are not always something that can be dodged which is why managing them is the next best
            option. Risks are something that happen because of unpredictability, but just because they are
            unpredictable, it does not mean that you cannot resolve those risks. A way to help monitor risks are to
            follow a five step process that will help you not only minize the risks that will happen during the project
            but also manage those risks that occur.

        <p><strong>Step 1: Identify the potential risks during a project life cycle</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The first step for the project management team when it comes to identifying potential risks is that
            you need to recognize the threats to the projects. The project manager needs to go through everything from
            the scope of the project, cost structure of the project, schedule of the project, to the scope creeps of the
            project. Once you are able to go through all of that, the team needs to start analyzing all of the potential
            risks that come along with all of those things involving the project. Once you are able to analyze those
            risks, the team should start to label them to from what is the most possible one to the least and then you
            need to start keeping track of those risks. Some of the professional in project management handle risks and
            label them between these four main risk categories. The first risk family are the technical risks, these
            include things like risks when it comes to the technology that you are using, or the even the technology
            that the product is going to use. Teams need to make sure that the technology that they are using and the
            ones that they are inputting into the project are all up to date and protected form attacks. The second risk
            family are external risks, these risks are things like how the market is holding up or what the demand from
            the customers for a certain product is or even how the weather is to make sure that the product or where the
            product is stored is in a safe place. The third risk family are organizational risks which refer to things
            like resources and the funding for the project, making sure that the project is well funded is a very
            important risk to keep track of. The fourth risk family are the project management risks which just refer to
            the team chemistry and how well the project team works together, this can be detrimental to the project
            because if the team is not able to work well together then the product that they produce will also not be at
            itâ€™s best.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Get ready on how to respond to the upcoming risks</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;The first thing that a project team should be focusing on here is that they need to appoint someone in
            the team as someone who is the leader for potential risks. When a risk shows up within a project life cycle,
            that leader needs to be able to take that risk and analyze and make sure that they are able to manage it.
            There are many ways to manage a risk, the first two main things that a risk leader should think about is
            that if a risk can be solved immediately or if there is something else that needs to be done beforehand.
            This can help manage those specific risks and having that risk leader should be able to keep risks showing
            up down.

        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Keeping track of potential risks that have showed up in a project life cycle</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Having the risk leaders and the project management team tracking all of the potential risks in the a
            project life cycle will help them all decide on what to do when a risk does show up. They will together be
            able to think about the response for each of the risks and how to manage them. This step not only talks
            about keeping track of them but once you are able to track the risks, the team needs to spend time analyzing
            those risks to make sure that they are able to understand why the risk showed up what they can start doing
            from now on in order to prevent those risks from coming up again.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Continue to spot new risks throughout the project life cycle</strong></p>
        <p> &emsp;Something that a project team needs to keep in mind is that as time goes on there will be new changes
            that will not only happen within the project but also the outside world. Due to these changes, the projects
            will also change as new things are changing the organization. If there are changes that are very major to
            the project that will start to bring up more risks than predicted, so having the risk leader keeping track
            of these new risks that are coming up through the project life cycle will help the team not be caught off
            guard and the project will be able to take care of those potential risks and keep the product efficient.

        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 5: Have a retrospective of your risk managing process throughout the project life cycle</strong>
        </p>
        <p> &emsp;Whether your project team was able to take care of all the risks or not, keeping track of all those
            risks and then finally going over those risks is something that a project team needs to do. When doing this
            the team will be able to understand how and why those risks showed up and they will be able to make sure
            that those risks are not occurring again.
