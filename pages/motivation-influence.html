    <h2>Motivation and Influence</h2>

    <img src="../images/motivation-influence.jpeg">

    <p>As a project manager, you should develop an understanding of how to motivate and influence your team to achieve the success of your project. These skills are non-technical and will transfer over from one project to the next. Throughout your career, you will likely interact with people who have a variety of motivation styles. You will also likely be put in positions where you need to utilize different forms of influence to maintain effectiveness as a leader.</p>

    <h3>Theories of Motivation</h3>
    <p>Psychologists have studied how to motivate people for decades. There are several theories of motivation that are more applicable to your role as a project manager.</p>
    <p>Intrinsic motivation is what causes people to complete a task or participate in an activity because of their own enjoyment. For example, a chef that honed their skills because they love cooking is intrinsically motivated.</p>
    <p>Extrinsic motivation is what causes people to complete a task to earn a reward or avoid a penalty. For example, a child will keep their room clean because their parents will not allow them to play with their friends if they do not.</p>
    <p>Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a theory that people are motivated to complete specific needs in a certain order. Physiological needs are at the bottom and include basic needs for the body to function such as food and water. Safety is second and includes physical safety and economic security. Social is the third layer; it includes acceptance, love, affection, and association with a team or group. The fourth layer is esteem which is made up of recognition, prestige, and status. The top layer of Maslow’s hierarchy is self-actualization consisting of challenging projects and opportunities for innovation and creativity. Maslow’s theory suggests that people will strive to accomplish each layer of needs in chronological order. Once satisfied, a need is no longer a motivating factor. Additionally, Maslow suggests that a person cannot satisfy the higher level needs without first handling the ones before. For example, a person cannot successfully pursue self-actualization without first satisfying their need for safety. Need categories one through four are considered deficiency needs while self actualization is considered a growth need.</p>
    <p>Frederick Herzberg is known for finding a difference between motivational factors and hygiene factors of employment. He defines hygiene factors as anything that could cause dissatisfaction if not present but would not encourage an employee to be more productive. Motivational factors, on the other hand, can influence workers to accomplish more. Some hygiene factors, which would cause dissatisfaction if not present, are larger salaries, more supervision, a more attractive workplace environment, computer or required equipment, health benefits, and training. Some motivational factors are achievement, recognition, work, responsibility, advancement, and growth.</p>
    <p>David McClelland’s acquired needs theory suggests that an individual's needs are learned or acquired over the course of their life and shaped by their experiences. The primary categories of needs are achievement, affiliation, and power. People with a higher need for achievement seek to excel and avoid both low and high risk situations to improve their chances for success in worthwhile areas of their lives. To manage team members who are achievers, you should give them regular feedback on their performance and challenging projects with achievable goals. Achievers are not necessarily motivated by money, but it is an effective form of feedback. People with a higher need for affiliation search for harmonious relationships with others and need to feel acceptance from people. They are more likely to conform to their work group and prefer work that has higher face to face interaction. To accommodate for your team members who need affiliation, you should strive to create a collaborative work environment. People with a need for power have a desire for either institutional or personal power. People who strive for institutional power want to organize people to further the organization’s goals. Personal power is the need to direct others. People who need personal power can be seen as bossy or micromanaging. Companies should try to put people with a need for organizational power in positions of leadership. As a project manager, try to focus on accomplishing the organization’s goals rather than directing your team members.</p>
    <p>Douglas McGregor is another psychologist who studied motivation. He is well known for his theories X and Y of motivation. Theory X suggests that employees are motivated to do the least amount of work in exchange for the highest level of security possible. Believers of theory X tend to use coercion, threats, and other control schemes to get employees to stay productive. Theory Y, on the other hand, suggests that employees do not completely dislike work and are motivated by self improvement. You should motivate your team members based on theory Y to get the best results.</p>
    <p>William Ouchi’s theory Z focuses on how employees view management in contrast to how theories X and Y focus on how managers view employees. Theory Z is based around the Japanese approach to motivation which puts more emphasis on building trust, quality, collective decision making, and cultural values. In theory Z, workers can be trusted to accomplish their work with maximum effort if managers can be trusted to support them and look out for their well being. Ouchi emphasizes job rotation, broadening of skills, generalization rather than specialization, and the need for continuous training.</p>
    
    <h3>Influence</h3>
    <p>There are nine ways that project managers can have influence over their teams.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Authority</li>
      <li>Assignment</li>
      <li>Budget</li>
      <li>Promotion</li>
      <li>Money</li>
      <li>Penalty</li>
      <li>Work Challenge</li>
      <li>Expertise</li>
      <li>Friendship</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Authority is the right to issue orders based on ranking in the organization's hierarchy. Assignment is the project manager’s ability to influence a worker’s placement on future projects. Budget is the perceived ability of a project manager to direct and authorize the use of discretionary funds. Promotion is the ability to give an employee a better position in the company. Money is the ability to increase pay and benefits. Penalty is the degree to which a project manager can dispense or cause punishment. Work challenge is the ability to assign work that taps into a worker’s intrinsic motivation because it maximizes their enjoyment of a particular task. Expertise is the specific knowledge that a project manager has which others consider important. Friendship is the ability of a project manager to establish friendly and healthy relationships with others. According to research conducted by Thamhain and Wilemon, projects are more likely to fail when managers put more emphasis on utilizing authority, money or penalty to influence their teams. On the other hand, teams were found to be more effective when managers focused more on work challenge and expertise, resulting in a higher likelihood of their projects’ success.</p>

    <p>With your newfound understanding of motivation and influence, you will be more effective as a team leader. Be sure to focus on using work challenge, expertise, and friendship to have more influence on your team. This will help you establish a positive work environment and will improve the likelihood of your project’s success. Additionally, be mindful of theory Y and Z when trying to motivate your employees. Looking out for your team members will improve their productivity and help the project succeed.</p>
