        <p>Risk in the scope of projects is the potential for some aspects of the project to go wrong, resulting in a
            negative impact on the project’s success. Since any project, whether it is an Information Technology (IT)
            project or not, comes with risks, naturally, project managers try to understand, analyze, and combat this
            risk through project risk management. Project risk management can be described as the process of determining
            and responding to project risks. IT based projects share the types of risks they entail with other projects,
            but certain risks matter more due to the technical nature of the project. Risk management, specifically
            designed for IT projects, will allow project stakeholders to better understand the project and its chances
            of success. </p>
        <p>Good project Risk management is unlike crisis management, which is a more imminent and direct response to a
            danger to the project, as it is less conspicuous. Where a crisis in the project may cause panic and grab
            most of the attention, whereas good project risk management results in less of such crises from ever
            occurring. Therefore, project risk management plays an equally if not more important role in a project.</p>

        <p>To exercise good project risk management, it is imperative that we first understand the common sources of
            risks that IT projects entail. Here we will discuss the main sources of risk.</p>



        <h3>Market Risk</h3>
        <p>Is the product or service that is being output at the end of the project fulfilling its useful purpose? How
            will the market receive the product or service? It is important to consider the risk that a product or
            service does not offer what the user needs and ends up failing because the user chooses another product or
            service that better fulfills their purpose. Studying this risk may involve studying the current market for
            the product or service, determining competition, and checking if there is someone else making the product or
            service more efficiently than you can.</p>

        <h3>Financial Risk</h3>
        <p>Undoubtedly, finance is the biggest challenge to any project as most projects, especially large-scale
            projects, can cost a fortune and are often over budget. Therefore, it is imperative that the project
            stakeholders, team, and managers appreciate that monetary losses should be minimized, and the efficiency of
            the project should be maximized. Can the company afford this project? What is the return on investment
            (ROI)? What is the Net present value (NPV) of the project? These are all imperative questions that must be
            asked before any financial investment is made in the undertaking of a project.</p>

        <h3>Technology Risk</h3>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, one of the greatest risks to an IT project is the technology itself. Many important questions
            need to be asked about the technology involved in either the input or the output of the project. Is it even
            technically possible to do or create what the project hopes for? What kind of technology should be used?
            Should the project use mature technology with lots of documentation or support or should it attempt to
            innovate using bleeding-edge technology? How long before the created technology is obsolete? Many more
            questions about the specifics of technology can make or break a project when considered.</p>

        <h3>Resource Risk</h3>
        <p>The project manager should carefully analyze if the project tasks undertaken can be completed by the current
            team members on the project. Do all the project members have the necessary skills to fulfill their
            objectives and tasks? If not, what kind of training and education is necessary for them to do so? How many
            people should be on this project and what should be the management structure. Many other resources can be
            taken into account. This is important and must not be ignored as heavy issues during the project life cycle.
            All project managers would benefit from paying attention to this and making sure that any risks related to
            these are addressed. More things can also be considered, such as the relationship between the stakeholders
            and the management and whether the people working on the project have undertaken a similar project before.
        </p>

        <h3>Security Risk</h3>
        <p>All threats to data confidentiality, integrity, or availability are of utmost importance as this directly
            affects the reputation of the company as well as the ability of the product to fulfill a useful purpose.
            Moreover, breaches in security and loss of user data due to organizational negligence or failure may entail
            more heavy penalties than just loss in sale and reputation, for example, government fines and restrictions.
            Therefore, it is of utmost importance that maximum possible security is provided within the constraints of
            the reasonable use of the product or service, otherwise, severe damage to reputation, organizational
            infrastructure, or heavy fines can be expected.</p>

        <h3>Legal and Regulatory Risk</h3>
        <p>All goods and services must follow certain quality control laws and standards that are put forth either by
            government or independent organizations. Meeting these requirements may be imperative to the success of a
            given project, especially in the cases where government laws are concerned. Laws differ from country to
            country and even from state to state, however, the most well-known data protection laws are regulations are:
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the California Consumer Privacy Act
            (CCPA) in the United States. In the healthcare industry, software must comply with regulations such as the
            Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Failure to adhere to these laws can incur
            severe penalties and will undoubtedly result in the failure of the project. Therefore, it is important that
            at every point, the law is abided by and observed carefully.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, project risk management is an important aspect of any project, especially in the case of IT
            projects. To exercise good project risk management, it is important to understand and analyze the common
            sources of risks that IT projects entail. The main sources of risks on IT projects include market risks,
            financial risks, technology risks, resources risks, security risks, and legal and regulatory risks. By
            carefully analyzing and responding to these risks, project stakeholders can better understand the project
            and its chances of success, minimize monetary losses, and maximize the efficiency of the project.
            Ultimately, good project risk management can result in the successful completion of a project within the
            allocated time frame and budget.</p>
